            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THEY who conſider ſeriouſly the miſchief which Hereſie and Schiſm bring along with them,<note place="margin">§. 1. The miſchief of Hereſie and Schiſm.</note> not only to the individual perſons that are guilty of them, but alſo to the Nations in which they are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, will certainly commend the endeavors of thoſe Sons of Peace who labor to Eſtabliſh Truth and Unity, and condemn theirs who ſeek all means poſſible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the one and obſtruct the other.</p>
            <p>They alſo who caſt an Eye upon the Controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion which have been agitated in this and the laſt Age, and the miſerable Broyls, and other worſe conſequences that have attended them, cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the unhappy fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> which has for ſo long time been the Seat of this Religious War. And they who will but impartially conſider matters, will find,<note place="margin">Catholics ſeek the beſt means to obtain Peace.</note> that Catholics have upon all occaſions ſought the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious means to procure this Chriſtian Peace, tho' to their grief they have ſtill been hindred from effecting this good work, by the ignorance of ſome, and the malice or ſelf-intereſt of others.</p>
            <p>The Defender tells us in the beginning of his Preface, that ſeveral Methods have been made uſe of in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Nation to reduce the pretended Reformed to the
<pb facs="tcp:104173:3"/>Catholic Communion; but that this of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> was looked upon as exceeding all others, in order to that end. This ſhews indeed the great Zeal thoſe perſons bad for the Salvation of their Brethren. And tho' the Defender is pleaſed to call thoſe excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the <hi>Perpetuity of the Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt</hi> Calviniſts, and M. <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s peaceable Method, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sophiſtical, and to repreſent M. <hi>de Meaux's</hi> Expoſition, as either <hi>palliating or perverting the Doctrin of his Church;</hi> Yet ſeeing he only aſſerts the former, without going about to prove it, and has been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful in the later charge (as I ſhall fully ſhew in the following Treatiſe) I hope the judicious Reader will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his Judgment till he has examined things himſelf, and not take all for Goſpel that is ſaid with confidence.</p>
            <p>He tells us alſo, that the <hi>Great deſign of theſe ſeveral Methods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>has been to prevent the Entring upon particular Diſputes;</hi> And pretends it was becauſe <hi>Experience had taught us, that ſuch particular Diſputes had been the leaſt favorable to us of any of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Truth is,<note place="margin">§. 2. We neither decline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, nor refuſe to fight with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at their own Weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We Appeal to Scripture.</note> we have never declined fighting with them at any Weapon, nor refuſed upon occaſion to enter upon each particular; neither need we go to <hi>France</hi> for Inſtances, we have enough at home.</p>
            <p>Some even amongſt the firſt pretended Reformers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to Scripture only; neither would they admit of Primitive Fathers nor Councils; and tho' theſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were for nothing but what was found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were convinced, by the following Sects, that their Reformation was defective, if Scripture alone was to be the Rule of Reformation; every Year almoſt, ſince the firſt Revolt, producing ſome new Reform of all thoſe that had gone before; And tho' Catholics might juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to argue from Scripture only, till Proteſtants had
<pb facs="tcp:104173:3"/>proved it to be the Word of God by ſome of their own Principles; yet were they not afraid to joyn Iſſue with them all, even in the Point of Scriptures clearneſs for our Doctrins, abſtracting from the Primitive Fathers and Councils. And thereupon, beſides ſeveral <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> the <hi>Catholic Scripturiſt</hi> and other excellent Books, two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes were publiſhed here in <hi>England,</hi> and never, that I heard of, Anſwered. The firſt,
<q>
                  <p>An Anchor of Chriſtian Doctrin, wherein the principal Points of Catholic Religion are proved by the only Written Word of God. <hi>in 4 Volums in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> Anno <hi>1622. The other,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Conference of the Catholic and Proteſtant Doctrin with the expreſs words of Scripture, being a ſecond part of the Catholic Ballance. Anno <hi>1631. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q> in which was ſhewn, that in more than 260 Points of Controverſie, Catholics agree with the Holy Scripture both in words and Senſe, and Proteſtants diſagree in both.</p>
            <p>Other Proteſtants perceiving they could not maintain ſeveral Tenets and Practices of their own by the bare words of Scripture,<note place="margin">§ 3. To the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils in all Ages.</note> and deſpairing of Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of later Ages, pretended at leaſt to admit the firſt four General Councils, and the Fathers of the firſt three or four hundred Years. But how meer a pretence this was, appeared by the many Books Written abroad upon that Subject, as <hi>Coccius</hi> his <hi>Theſaurus, Gualterus</hi> his <hi>Chronology</hi> and others; and at home Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> found it too hard a task to make a reply to <hi>Dean</hi> Crecy<hi>'s Anſwer to his Court Sermon;</hi> and the preſent nibling at the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> ſhew how hard a task they find it to elude their plain expreſſions.</p>
            <p>A third ſort of Proteſtants ventured to name Tradition as an uſeful means to arrive at the True Faith;<note place="margin">§. 4. To an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Tradition.</note> but many excellent Treatiſes have ſhewn, that no other Doctrins
<pb facs="tcp:104173:4"/>will bide that Teſt, but ſuch as are taught by the Catholic Church. For Novelty (which is a diſtinctive mark of Error) appearing in the very Name of <hi>Reformation,</hi> an uninterrupted Tradition can never be laid claim to by them who pretend to be Reformers. And indeed the exceptions which they uſually make, and the General Cry againſt Fathers, Councils and Tradition, ſhew how little they dare rely upon them.</p>
            <p>Nay there has not been any thing like an Argument produced againſt our Faith, or to juſtifie their Schiſm, but what has been abundantly Anſwered and refuted; and yet the ſame Sophiſms are returned upon us as Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Coyn, notwithſtanding they have been often brought to the Teſt, and could not ſtand it.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Catholics have ſo far complyed with the infirmities of their Adverſaries, that they have left no Stone unturned to reduce them to Unity of Faith, and that by meekneſs, as well as powerful reaſonings.</p>
            <p>They have not only condeſcended to ſatisfie the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of them who have moſt leiſure, by Writing large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums upon every particular Controverſie, proving what they hold by Scripture, Councils, Fathers, Reaſon, and all other preſſing Arguments; but becauſe moſt perſons cannot get time to peruſe ſuch vaſt Treatiſes, they have gon a ſhorter way to work, and ſome have manifeſted the Truth of our Doctrin from the unerrable Authority of the Church of Chriſt, againſt which he had promiſed that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail:</hi> Others ſhewed it from the nature of Truth and Error, and the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility that an Univerſal Tradition could fail, eſpecially when God had promiſed,<note place="margin">Iſa. 59.20, 21.</note> that the <hi>words he would put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Mouths, ſhould not depart out of their Mouths, nor out of the Mouth of their Seed, nor out of the Mouth of their Seeds Seed, from henceforth and for ever.</hi> Others again,
<pb facs="tcp:104173:4"/>as the <hi>Proteſtant Apology,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And ſhew the truth of our Doctrins from Proteſtants own Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> proved the innocence and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of our Doctrin from the Teſtimony of Learned Proteſtants themſelves, of whom one held one Article and another another; from whence they hoped at leaſt to make our Doctrins be looked upon as leſs offenſive.</p>
            <p>But Proteſtants finding it a very difficult task to elude ſuch ſtrong Reaſons as have and might be brought for the neceſſary and unerrable Authority of the Church;<note place="margin">§. 5. But Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants fly to particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; and in them to the particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> ſtill as if they were uneaſie, by all means endeavored to ſhuffle off ſuch Arguments as would make ſhort work of the buſineſs, and flew out at every loop-hole to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſputes, and the private Opinions of the Schools, where they knew they could enlarge, and talk ſo long, that Years might paſs before they could be ſilenced, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time they hoped the Readers as well as Writers would be tired, and by that means they might get their ends.</p>
            <p>And whereas Catholics all along deſired them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves firſt, what the Church held to be of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Faith, before they entred into Diſpute or Writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and thereupon to take their Doctrins from the Councils and Univerſally received Practices,<note place="margin">And at the laſt to down-right railing.</note> and not from Private Doctors, or actions of particulars; it was impoſſible to obtain of them to do it with calmeneſs: but when ever any Argument pinched, they fell to railing, and began to blacken our Faith, to miſrepreſent our Doctrins, Caluminate our Practices, and Ridicule our Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>And, as the World go's now, he that could Rail the moſt, being looked upon as having the better end of the Staff, and Calumnies ſinking deeper into the Memories of the Vulgar than ſolid Reaſons, Catholics grew by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to be looked upon as bad as Devils, and their Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins as the Dictates of Hell it ſelf.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104173:5"/>
            <p>Hence it was,<note place="margin">§. 6. Therefore a plain Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Doctrin was thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> that others again thought it neceſſary to deliver our Doctrin according to the Genuin and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Senſe of our Councils, and abſtracting from the private Diſputes of School-men, inſiſt only upon thoſe Doctrins which were univerſally and neceſſarily received: Neither was the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> the firſt or only Man that did it. <hi>Verron</hi> had preceded him in <hi>France,</hi> and in the beginning of Queen <hi>Marys</hi> Days an Expoſition was Publiſhed here in <hi>England</hi> much what of the ſame Nature, tho' in a different Method.</p>
            <p>To theſe I might add the Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and many others Publiſhed in every Country.</p>
            <p>So,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> that we may juſtly ſay, we are now fallen into ſuch like times as thoſe which were foretold by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which People <hi>will not endure ſound Doctrin, but, having itching Ears after Novelties, chooſe to themſelves Teachers according to their own Deſires.</hi> Only this is our comfort, that we have not been wanting in our Duty, we have <hi>Preached the Word of God,</hi> we have been <hi>inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon,</hi> we have <hi>reproved,</hi> we have <hi>rebuked,</hi> we have <hi>exhorted, with all long-ſuffering and Doctrin;</hi> but they have <hi>turned away their Ears from the Truth,</hi> and believed <hi>Fables.</hi> We have uſed all the means we can to calm the minds of People, that being United in one Faith we might prove our ſelves to be the followers of Chriſt; but hitherto all has been ineffectual through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome whoſe credulity made them believe every Cry againſt Popery; and the malice of others, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt prompted them to defame us.</p>
            <p>The Truth of which will appear more clearly,<note place="margin">§. 7. A Brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Religion of our Anceſtors, from the firſt Converſion of this Nation, till <hi>H.</hi> the <hi>8ths.</hi> Schiſm.</note> whilſt I give a brief account of our Controverſies in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of that betwixt the Defender and me in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.

            <p>It is not denyed by our Adverſaries,<note place="margin">Catholic Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion early Eſtabliſhed in our Nation.</note> but that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion took very early Root in this Nation, and ſome Remains of it were found when St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin Monk was ſent hither by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, to reduce the Pagan Idolaters to the Faith of Chriſt. St. <hi>Bede,</hi> who Writes the Hiſtory of his coming, tells us, there was carried before him a Banner, with the Effigies of Chriſt upon the Croſs; and that he came in with a Proceſſion, Singing the Litanies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He tells us alſo, that notwithſtanding the long want of intercourſe with <hi>Rome</hi> and the Members of that Communion, occaſioned by great Oppreſſions and Perſecutions during the Reign of Pagan Kings; yet had there not many Errors crept into this Chriſtian part of the Nation: for St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> only found two Cuſtoms amongſt them, which he could not Tollerate,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans agree in all things but keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> and ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> the one their keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> at a wrong time with the <hi>Quarto-decimani;</hi> and the other ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Ceremonies of Adminiſtring Baptiſm: theſe two he earneſtly ſollicited them to amend; but they were obſtinate, and would not ſuffer any Reformation in thoſe two Points, till God was pleaſed to Teſtifie his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Authority he came with, by the Authentic Seal of Miracles.</p>
            <p>Our Adverſaries alſo do moſt of them acknowledge, that when St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> he taught moſt, if not all, the ſame Doctrins the Roman Catholic Church now Teaches, and introduced thoſe Practices which they now are pleaſed to call Superſtitions; But theſe Doctrins and Practices, were either then Taught and exerciſed by the Britiſh Chriſtians alſo, or they were not; If they were not taught by them, certainly we ſhould not have found them ſo eaſily ſubmit to ſuch Practices and Tenets as our Adverſaries call plain and down-right Superſtitions and Idolatries; and if they were then
<pb facs="tcp:104173:6"/>taught alſo by the Brittiſh Chriſtians, they were certainly of a much longer ſtanding than St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> time; and our Adverſaries, who pretend the reaſon why they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, becauſe ſhe has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Novelties in matters of Faith, may be from thence convinced of the Antiquity of thoſe Doctrins they now call Novelties; and muſt either grant they were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel here, or ſhew evidently ſome other time before St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> when this Church embraced them.</p>
            <p>This Faith and theſe Exerciſes Taught and Practiſed by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 8.

            <p>It is ſufficiently known alſo, that he approved not of the new Doctrin, that was brought in by <hi>Luther</hi> during his Reign, neither would he permit ſuch a pretended Reformation, ſo that the whole conteſt during that time was only about the Supremacy of St. <hi>Peters</hi> See. But as Schiſm is moſt commonly followed with Hereſie; ſo in King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6ths</hi> time,<note place="margin">Edward the 6th.</note> the Protector, who was tainted with <hi>Zwinglianiſm,</hi> a Reform from <hi>Luther,</hi> endeavored to ſet it up here in <hi>England;</hi> and from that time the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
<pb facs="tcp:104173:6"/>Doctrin which had been taught by our firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and propagated till then, begun to be rejected and accuſed as Erroneous, Superſtitious and Idolatrous, and they who Profeſſed it, Perſecuted.</p>
            <p>But this Kings Reign being but ſhort,<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </note> Catholic Religion begun again to bud forth under Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but that Bud being early nipped by her Death, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the advice of the new Council which ſhe choſe,<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
               </note> and to ſecure her ſelf in the Throne, reſolved to deſtroy the Catholic Intereſt, and ſet up a Prelatic Proteſtancy which might have the face of a Church; but other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformers oppoſed her Prelates and called their Orders Anti-chriſtian, and would needs have the Rags and Remnants of Popery, as they called 'em, taken away, telling them, that if the Word of God was to be the ſole Rule of Reformation, ſuch things as were not to be found in that Rule, were certainly to be rejected.</p>
            <p>From that time this Nation has been variouſly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Diſputes,<note place="margin">The firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, accuſed the Catholic Church with all bitterneſs imaginable.</note> and tho' they could not agree amongſt themſelves, yet they ſet up unanimouſly their Crys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Catholic Church, as if ſhe had been the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy; and they were looked upon to be the beſt Subjects that could bring the moſt plauſible Arguments againſt her Doctrins; or move the Common People moſt to reject her Practices.</p>
            <p>During this time the Pope was accuſed as Anti-chriſt, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as the Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> neither was there any thing committed by the Heathens worthy reprehenſion, that was not laid to the charge of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church; ſo furious was their rage againſt the Truth.</p>
            <p>But things growing calmer in King <hi>James,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They were more calm in K. &amp; K. <hi>Ch.</hi> the firſts time.</note> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſts time, ſuch Calumnies and Accuſations were looked upon by the more Learned party as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb facs="tcp:104173:7"/>of Paſſion, and Moderation taught them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a Mother Church, that Salvation was to be had in her, that many of thoſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations which were brought againſt her were but the Dreams of diſtracted Brains; and the more moderate perſons begun to look upon her with a more favorable Eye; but ſtill the averſion which the Vulgar and leſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People had imbibed, from ſo long continued Slanders, could not be taken away; and the ariſing Factions in the State blew up the Coals afreſh, and pretended this Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was nothing but an inclination to Popery, which ſo frighted the Mobile, that they were ready to joyn with any party that pretended to ſuppreſs ſuch a Monſter, as they thought it to be; from hence came Rebellions and the horrid Murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt.</p>
            <p>After which the Prelatic Party here in <hi>England</hi> were as much run down as the Catholic, and underwent a common Baniſhment, during which they entertained a fair Correſpondence; the Proteſtant finding by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Catholics were Loyal Subjects, conſcientious Dealers, and conſtant Friends.</p>
            <p>This fair Correſpondence abroad was the cauſe of a no leſs pleaſing Union after the happy Reſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond,<note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond.</note> during the beginning of whoſe Reign, Catholics were not otherwiſe much moleſted by the Governing party, but only kept out of Employments; till <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and his Adherents invented a malitious Calumny, laying a pretended Plot to their charge, by which they put the Nation into ſuch a Flame, that Papiſts were become the moſt odious People in the World, and Popery the greateſt Crime.</p>
            <p>But the Truth of this Sham-Plot being detected by a ſubſequent real one; the Innocent ſufferings of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics raiſed Compaſſion in the more moderate Church of
<pb facs="tcp:104173:7"/>
               <hi>England</hi> Men, and they ſeemed to be willing they who had ſuffered ſo unjuſtly ſhould enjoy ſomething a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter liberty; but ſtill the Laws enacted againſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in force, there were perſons enough ready to put them in Execution.</p>
            <p>In this poſture were Affairs,<note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond.</note> when it pleaſed God to take to himſelf his late Majeſty: No ſooner was his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty Aſcended upon the Throne, but he declared himſelf a Catholic, to the unſpeakable joy of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, and grief of others, who did not ſtick to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they ſaw nothing wanting in his Majeſty fitting for a King, but only (as they thought) a better Religion.</p>
            <p>At his coming to the Crown, his Majeſty was pleaſed to declare, that he looked upon the Church of <hi>England</hi> as proceeding upon Loyal Principles, and that he would protect her; this (as it might well) gained the hearts of that party, who little expected ſuch a gratious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from one, whom they had always looked upon as a Member of the Catholic Church, whoſe Principles they had been taught were too cruel to make uſe of ſuch Lenitives; and this being again Repeated at the opening of the firſt Parliament, had ſo much Power upon the minds of the Loyal party, that notwithſtanding the concluſion of a Sermon Preached before them,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sherlocs</hi> Sermon <hi>May</hi> 29. 1685.</note> in which it was declared, that <hi>an Engliſh-man might be Loyal, but not a Papiſt,</hi> that Parliament teſtified it's Loyalty to ſuch a Degree as will never be forgotten; and would, I am confident, have proceeded in the ſame manner, had not ſome factious Spirits animated the Pulpits Zeal, and thrown fears and jealouſies into the minds of thoſe who were bigotted in their Religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this Sermon to the Houſe of Commons was the occaſion of our following Controverſies,<note place="margin">§. 9. The riſe of the Preſent Controverſies.</note> as being
<pb facs="tcp:104173:8"/>the firſt thing, that appeared in Print againſt Roman Catholics, (tho' the Author of the Preſent State of the Controverſies, would not take notice of it.) And they who ſeriouſly conſidered the timing of it, the perſons to whom it was ſpoken, the ſeverity of the accuſation, and the manner of Publiſhing it, made their conjectures then, that it was like a throwing out the Gantlet, and bidding defiance to all the Catholics in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some ſhort remarks were made upon this Sermon, in a Paper called <hi>a Remonſtrance by way of Addreſs from the Church of</hi> England <hi>to both Houſes of Parliament.</hi> This occaſioned the Doctors reply, in which he not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to vindicate himſelf, but threw all the dirt he could upon the Catholic Church, laying all the faults of particulars at the Churches Door, after ſuch a manner, as ſhewed him neither to underſtand our Doctrin, nor the Principles we go upon.</p>
            <p>It appeared from hence, that nothing was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected but clamor, inſincerity, and miſrepreſentation; and therefore tho' an Anſwer was prepared and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, yet was it thought fit (by thoſe who were to be obeyed) to let the Controverſie dye, rather than ſtir up a Religious Litigation, upon a Point, which not only the proteſtations of Catholics, but their Practices had juſtified them in.</p>
            <p>However, ſeeing the Doctors Vindication as well as all the other Books Written ſince the Pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, had been chiefly filled up with miſtakes or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations of our Doctrins, all which were taken upon truſt, as Real Truths, not only by the Vulgar; but by many, who tho' pretending to Learning, had (as appeared) never Read any but their own party, or at leaſt but ſuperficially; Charity prompted a good Man to ſhew our Doctrins truly as they are in themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:104173:8"/>the Mixtures of the particular Opinions of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or the Practices which are neither univerſally nor neceſſarily received.</p>
            <p>And in order to this he Publiſhed a Book under the Title of <hi>a Papiſt Miſrepreſented and Repreſented,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Papiſt Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and Repreſented.</note> in which the Judicious and Learned Author ſhewed in one Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umn what was commonly received amongſt the Vulgar as the Doctrin of Papiſts; and in the oppoſite the true Doctrin of the Catholic Church was repreſented with all the ſincerity and candor imaginable.</p>
            <p>All moderate perſons, who would give themſelves the liberty to Read and think, acknowledged that Catholics and their Religion had been ſtrangely miſrepreſented, and were apt to lay great faults upon their Leaders, who had, even from their Pulpits, ſeconded the common Cry.</p>
            <p>But that party being loath to be thought to have any faults, could not endure to be looked upon as Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and therefore notwithſtanding they could not deny, but all that was there expoſed under the Title of a Miſrepreſenter, was at leaſt according to the common Notion People had of Popery, yet was it not to be called Miſrepreſenting; and tho' they could not deny but all Catholics believe according to that Doctrin which the Repreſenter expreſſes, yet muſt this paſs for new Popery and we muſt be accuſed as if we receded from the Faith of our immediate Predeceſſors, whilſt we affirm that any change from the Faith delivered by a continual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles muſt needs be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>This occaſioned ſeveral Tart Anſwers and Reply's, till at laſt the Controverſie dwindled into nothing but a Verbal Diſpute, whether telling the World that Popery is Idolatrous, Diſloyal, bloody-minded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be properly ſpeaking a Miſrepreſentation or ſome other word?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104173:9"/>
            <p>During this diſpute two Books were Publiſhed, with the ſame Charitable, and as was hoped, inoffenſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The firſt the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts of the General Aſſembly of the French Clergy in the Year</hi> 1685. <hi>concerning Religion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts of the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</note> 
               <hi>together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the ſaid General Aſſembly againſt the Calumnies, Injuries and Falſities which the pretended Reformed have, and do, every day publiſh in their Books and Sermons againſt the Doctrin of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſign of which Book was the ſame with that of the Papiſt Miſrepreſented and Repreſented, with this only difference, that in Repreſenting the Tenets of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, it made uſe only of the words of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and the Profeſſion of Faith extracted out of it; and in Repreſenting the Calumnies formed againſt our Doctrins obſerved Religiouſly the expreſſions of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Authors, whoſe very words were cited in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            <p>This was ſo clear a proof of what the Repreſenter had ſaid, that 'tis ſuppoſed his Adverſaries would not think fit to conteſt it longer againſt ſuch plain and ample Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies.</p>
            <p>The other was the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Meaux<hi>'s Expoſition of the Doctrin of the Catholic Church in matters of Controverſie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A Book received by all perſons in the Catholic Church of all Ranks and Degrees, as containing nothing in it but the Orthodox Doctrin of the Church. But all the Repeated Teſtimonies of his Holineſs and the Cardinals, Prelates and Doctors of the Church were not enough to make our Adverſaries believe it to contain our Doctrins truly; ſo ſtrangely had they been Miſrepreſented to them. And therefore out comes preſently another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Expoſition of the Doctrin of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Preface of which Book the Author pretended
<pb facs="tcp:104173:9"/>to ſhew that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s deſign was only to palliate or pervert the Doctrins of his Church, becauſe (forſooth) his Manuſcript Copy (or if you will the Real firſt tho' not Authenticated impreſſion) differed in ſome points from what was Printed and allowed of as the firſt Impreſſion.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe for a moment, if he will, that what he ſays were true; that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Manuſcript was defective in ſome points, and differently expreſſed from what it is now in others; ſuppoſe the Biſhop had permitted an impreſſion to be made, or (as Cardinal <hi>Peron</hi> is ſaid to have done, and which it may be was all the Biſhop did) had cauſed a dozen or fourteen Copies to be Printed off, to ſhew them to his friends before he would put the laſt hand to his Book; nay (if you will) let us ſuppoſe, that ſome of the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> were of the number of thoſe friends to whom he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thoſe Copies, and that they had made ſome Corrections, Obſervations or Additions; what is all that (as the Biſhop ſays) to the Book as it is at preſent? We ſend them not to the Manuſcript, nor to the firſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (if a few ſuch Copies could be properly called an Impreſſion) but to the Book as it is now Printed and and approved of, as containing the Doctrin of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church.</p>
            <p>As for the Refutation of all the Defenders Arguments upon this head, I ſhall refer my Reader to the Biſhops own Letter Publiſhed in the Appendix: Only whereas the Defender in his Preface to the Expoſition, <hi>page</hi> 2. inſinuates, that the late Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi> did not owe his Converſion to that Book, but to ſome other perſonal Conferences or Papers to them unknown; I muſt tell him the Mareſchal has more then once expreſſed the juſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem he had for that Book, as for that which firſt opened
<pb facs="tcp:104173:10"/>his Eyes and gave him ſatisfaction, and did frequently recommend it to others, aſſuring them, that if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it with diligence, it would work the ſame effect in them. If the Defender doubt of the truth of this, the Right Honorable the Lord <hi>John Bellaſſiſe,</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Commiſſioner for the Treaſury, will aſſure him, that he had it from his own mouth.</p>
            <p>In the Body of the Book he runs through all the Points mentioned by the Biſhop,<note place="margin">§. 10. The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betwixt the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the Defender.</note> ſtill laying ſuch Doctrins to our charge, and backing them with ſuch weak Reaſons, and falſified Authorities, that I thought it my Duty (as having Publiſhed the Biſhops Expoſition in our Engliſh Tongue) to detect the fallacies and lay open the falſifications; this I did in my <hi>Vindication</hi> ſhewing him upon all occaſions, that what he oppoſed as our Doctrin either was not at all our Doctrin, and the Authorities he brought to back his Aſſertion falſified or miſunderſtood; or elſe if it was the Doctrin of ſome particulars, yet was it neither univerſally nor neceſſarily embraced by the Church, and therefore not eſteemed by us as of Catholic Faith.</p>
            <p>To this he has made a Reply in his</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Defence of the Doctrin of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>In which they, who Examin nothing but the bold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of an Author, will think that he had much the better of it, and that the Vindicators Arguments were but <hi>ſilly,</hi> and that the falſifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lay at his own Door: But they who will either take the pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin matters throughly, or Read this following Reply without prejudice, will I hope, ſee the matter cleared, and that, notwithſtanding all our Defenders pretences, he has not ſo much as vindicated one of his falſifications, nor brought any one Argument, but which is merely a fallacy, againſt our Doctrin.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104173:10"/>
            <p>I ſhall not go about to prevent the Reader by running through the whole,<note place="margin">§. 11.

            <p>How do ſome People labor to prove,<note place="margin">§. 12.

            <p>For we aſſure them, that we Adore none but God in the utmoſt propriety of the phraſe;<note place="margin">We honor but adore them not.</note> but if you take <hi>Adore</hi> for <hi>Honor</hi> in an Inferior Degree, we acknowledge that the Saints and Angels may be honored with ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior honor, nay all animated Creatures whatever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Dignity. If you deny it to be lawful to give this Inferior honor to the Saints, prove it and you write againſt us, otherwiſe all your labor is but ſpent in vain.</p>
            <p>As to Images, we ſay, that what we call Veneration for them is no other than an honor pay'd,<note place="margin">§. 13. Images.</note> where we truly owe it, to thoſe for whoſe ſake we uſe ſuch things otherwiſe then common things.

I ſay however, theſe expreſſions of the Schools may be eaſily defended when they expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their own Senſe, if we conſider alſo what they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be neceſſary Articles of our Faith.</p>
            <p>Thus in this particular our neceſſary Doctrin is that <hi>God alone is to be Adored with Divine Worſhip,</hi> This all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſent to: When therefore Scholaſtics ſpeak of Adoration given to Images, their expreſſions are to be interpreted, ſo that they ſhock not this their firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
<pb facs="tcp:104173:11"/>They tell you indeed of a Relative Adoration, but when they explicate what they mean by it, it is no more than what our Defender himſelf muſt Practiſe; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when he makes an Act of Adoration to God or Jeſus Chriſt, he Forms an Idea or Image in his Mind (for he will not I ſuppoſe ſay, he has at thoſe times the Beatifical Viſion) but that Image tho' it be only a faint Repreſentative, yet is in it's Repreſentative nature one with the Object which it Repreſents, and the Adoration which he pays to God he pays to him as Repreſented by that Image, without making at all times a reflection of the difference betwixt that Image and the Object that it Repreſents; and that Homage which he there pays is Divine Adoration, not Abſolute to the Idea or Image, but Relative in Preſence of the Idea to the Object which it Repreſents. And thus, ſay they, we may Adore Jeſus Chriſt in Preſence of a Material Image, neither is there any other difference betwixt the Idea and this Material Image, than, that the one is in our Mind by ſomething which was formerly in our Senſes, and the other is in our Mind by ſomething which at that time ſtrikes our Senſes; but the Adoration which is there performed is neither in the one nor in the other to the Image, but to God whom it Repreſents. And this is all that Scholaſtic Divines, and that Cardinal <hi>Capiſucchi</hi> means in that paſſage which our Defender cites from him, which I give you entirely in the Margent<note n="*" place="margin">Ex his conſtat in Concili.

            <p>As for Juſtification,<note place="margin">§. 14.

               </note> that <hi>we are Juſtified</hi> Gratis, <hi>and that none of thoſe Acts which precede our Juſtification whether they be Faith or good Works can Merit this Grace;</hi> but if after ſuch a Declaration they will not believe us, we can only pity them and Pray to God to make them leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</p>

            <p>What a deal of ſtuff have we ſeen of late concerning Purgatory, even by thoſe who acknowledge,<note place="margin">§. 15. Purgatory.</note> that all the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> determins is, <hi>that there is a Purgatory</hi> [or middle ſtate] <hi>and that the Souls that are detained there, are helped the ſuffrages of the Faithful, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the moſt acceptable Sacrifice of the Altar.</hi> It is not what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> looks upon as Truths, that we ought to maintain; but only what is of neceſſary Faith, and that is defined by the Council. It is therefore no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of neceſſary Faith (without the belief of which we cut our ſelves off from the Communion of the Faithful) that there is a Fire in Purgatory,<note place="margin">A ſhort ſummary of the Principal Controverſies, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 42.</note> neither has the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Florence</hi> defined it, tho' a late Pamphlet ſays it did. It is not defined what the pains are, nor how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous nor how long they ſhall laſt. Had thoſe Authors therefore let theſe Points alone, and only Written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a middle ſtate, the Printer would have got leſs by them, but the People more.</p>
            <p>Separate alſo what is not of Faith from Indulgences,
<pb facs="tcp:104173:13"/>and the Controverſie will be brought to this; whether <hi>the Power of Indulgences hath been given and left in the Church by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Indulgences.</note> and <hi>whether the uſe of them be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to Chriſtian People</hi> or no; ſo that we ſhould have nothing to do in our diſputes about the Treaſure of the Church, nor about Indulgences whereby the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due in the Court of God ſin remitted may be taken away, or the pains in Purgatory; but only about a Power to remit to Penitents ſome part of their public Canonical Penances, if their life and laudable Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed to deſerve it.</p>
            <p>We affirm only,<note place="margin">§. 16. Sacraments.</note> that <hi>there are truly and properly Seven Sacraments in the New Law Inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt, and neceſſary for the Salvation of Mankind, tho' not all to every one.</hi> And our Adveſaries ſay, <hi>there are two only generally neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> but dare not poſitively exclude the others from being a kind of particular Sacraments. And ſeeing the Scripture mentions not the number ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of three or ſeven, why ſhould not the voice and conſtant practice of the Church be heard before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular clamours?</p>
            <p>As to the matter of the Euchariſt, if People would but once take a right notion of what we mean by a Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and rightly underſtand what we mean by the Terms <hi>Corporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> we ſhould not have ſuch large Volumns Written by thoſe who pretend to believe all that Chriſt has ſaid.</p>

            <p>In a word,<note place="margin">§. 17. The Rule of Faith.</note> would People take notice, that we affirm <hi>the Total and only Rule of Catholic Faith,</hi> to which all are obliged under pain of Hereſie and Excommunication,
<pb facs="tcp:104173:13"/>
               <hi>to be Divine Revelation delivered to the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and propoſed by the Catholic Church in her General received Councils, or by her univerſal Practice as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Catholic Faith,</hi> and that if either this Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the Prophets and Apoſtles, or this propoſal by the univerſal Church be wanting to a Tenet, it ceaſes to be an <hi>Article</hi> or Doctrin of <hi>Faith,</hi>

            <p>Whereas by the methods by which we ſee Diſputes now carried on,<note place="margin">But prolong diſputes upon unneceſſaries.</note> one would think our Adverſaries had no other end in all their Controverſial Books or Sermons, but to cry down Popery at any rate, leaſt they ſhould ſuffer prejudice by it's increaſe, which they are conſcious it would do, if what is of Faith were ſeparated in all their Diſcourſes from Inferior Truths or probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I am not willing to prolong diſputes,<note place="margin">§. 18. Which the Vindicator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline.</note> I do here declare, that if the Defender do hereafter medle with ſuch points as thoſe which are not of neceſſary Faith, I ſhall not think my ſelf obliged to anſwer him, tho' after that he may perhaps boaſt how he had the laſt word.</p>
            <p>But if he pleaſe to anſwer any thing poſitively to thoſe Doctrins acknowledged by all Catholics to be of Faith,
<pb facs="tcp:104173:14"/>or to the Arguments I have brought in the XXIII. and and XXIV. Articles to prove the Church in Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Orthodox Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, and that the voice of the Church in every Age is the beſt way to know what is Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon finiſhing which two laſt diſputes all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie would be ended; he ſhall have a fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But I may be bold to foretel, without pretending to be a Prophet, that nothing of all this will be done; and that if he vouchſafe an Anſwer, he will as to the firſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill fly to the private Tenets and Practices of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, or Miſrepreſent our Doctrin; and as to the others either fob my Arguments off with ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as he thinks is ſufficient againſt Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Perpetuity,<note place="margin">Deſence Pref. <hi>pag.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>that is, calling it a Logical ſubtilty, which wants only</hi> Diogenes<hi>'s, Demonſtration, to expoſe it's Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;</hi> A pretty quirk indeed, were the caſe parallel, or that it could be made out as clearly, that the Church has erred, as it could be ſhewn that <hi>Diogenes</hi> moved; but what is the Point in Queſtion muſt be always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as certain in our Defenders Logic; or elſe he will ſend us to his beloved friends Monſieur <hi>Daille,</hi> or Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> as he has upon the like occaſions; or laſtly endeavor to expoſe us by ſome contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Raillery, as he has done the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> to the Defenders own confuſion amongſt thinking Men. For</p>
            <p>It is not enough to Men of Senſe to ſpeak contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly of ſolid Arguments, excellent Diſcourſes, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of known integrity. <hi>Monſieur</hi> Arnauld<hi>'s Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Faith,</hi> and the <hi>juſt Prejudices againſt the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts</hi> will not looſe their eſteem amongſt the Learned
<pb facs="tcp:104173:14"/>and Judicious becauſe our Defender tels us they have been out-done by Huguenots; neither will the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s credit be any ways impaired, or his Expoſition leſs eſteemed becauſe the Defender, and ſuch as he, have endeavored to traduce him, and make the World believe him to be Inſincere or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
            <p>But ſuch things as theſe are now a-days put upon the World without a bluſh, and they who are this day ingenious, Learned and honeſt Men, ſhall be to morrow time-ſervers, block-heads and knaves if they chance but to caſt a favorable look towards Popery, and hated, abhorred, and oppreſſed with injurles if they forſake their Errors to embrace the Truth, even by thoſe who pretend that Conſcience ought not to be forced.</p>
            <p>I muſt conclude this Preface with begging pardon of my Readers for the length of this work which will I fear deter ſome from the peruſal of it, but I hope, they who are deſirous to ſearch for the True Faith, which is but one amongſt ſo many, and without which <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> will not think it much to ſpend a little time for their ſatisfaction; which if they do I hope it will open their Eyes and they will ſee how much they have been hitherto kept in ignorance by thoſe who pretend to be their guides, but ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Writing either to be blind, or which is worſe, malitious. For if they know our Doctrins and yet Miſrepreſent them to their People, they muſt be convinced of Malice; and if they know them not, we are ready to inform them; if they think we palliate or pervert our Doctrins to gain Proſelites, it ſhews how little they underſtand our Tenets; For when
<pb facs="tcp:104173:15"/>they ſee us ready to loſe our Eſtates, our Liberties, and our Lives, rather than renounce one title of our Faith, how can a reaſonable Man be perſuaded we would renounce it all to gain a Proſelite, who, the very firſt time he ſhould ſee us Practiſe contrary to our Doctrins, would be ſure to return and expoſe our Villany?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There was a time (as this Author knows) in which the genuin Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> excuſed the Roman Catholic Church of that odious Imputation of Idolatry, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Doctrin of the Church (as to that particular) to be innocent.<note place="margin">

                  <p>I would gladly therefore know how it comes to paſs,<note place="margin">Defence p. 88.</note> that at this time (when he acknowledges <hi>there was never more cauſe to hope for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and wiſhes that all ſuch things as heighten our <hi>Animoſities, might on all ſides be buried in eternal Oblivion,</hi>) An Expoſition of the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be uſhered in with that odious Imputation of <hi>Adoring Men and Women, Croſſes and Images,</hi> &amp;c. Where do's he find the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Thirty Nine Articles or publick Teſtimonies of her <hi>Dogmatical Doctrin,</hi> charging the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſuch Idolatry? We find indeed that their Twenty ſecond Article tells us, that the Invocation of Saints is one of thoſe Practices
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104173:18"/>which are <hi>fond things, vainly invented,</hi> &amp;c. but it proceeds not ſo far as to call it <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> And if the <hi>Book of Homilies</hi> (to which he flies upon other occaſions when he is preſt to ſhew the Doctrin of his Church) be more ſevere, he is little verſed in his own Doctrins, if he be ignorant that ſeveral Eminent Divines of his own Church do not allow that Book to contain <hi>in every part of it the publick Dogmatical Doctrin of the Church of</hi> England,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I wiſh then there be not ſomething more in the bottom of this than what appears at firſt ſight. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">§. 2. The charge of Idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> time.</note> 
                     <q>that when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> beheld the Pope as her greateſt Enemy in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her Mothers Marriage, her own Birth, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> Books were filled with <hi>bitter Revilings</hi> againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome and all the Divine Offices, Ceremonies and performances of it;</hi>

                     </q> And what, muſt the ſame Apprehenſions be now again raiſed in the Peoples minds? Muſt the Pope paſs now for our greateſt Enemy? And muſt the common People be taught to <hi>hate Papiſts worſe than Jews and Mahumetans,</hi>

                  <p>But what if our Authors allow not thoſe things which he charges them with, will he then acknowledge himſelf guilty of <hi>Calumny</hi> If he cannot bring any of our Authors that ſay, <hi>Divine Worſhip is to be given to the Bleſſed Virgin and Saints departed</hi> (unleſs their expreſſions be miſerably diſtorted) or any perſons that do practice it; if our Miſſals and Pontificals do not command us to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Croſs</hi> taking the word <hi>Adoration</hi> in that ſtrict Senſe; and if I ſhew him in the following Articles that he miſtakes the Doctrin of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> about the Sacriſice of the Maſs, and the Churches Tenet about Merit; I hope he will be ſo ingenuous as to confeſs; that we deſerve not ſo ill a Character; and if he be ſo ſenſible of the <hi>account which muſt be given for idle words,</hi>

                  <p>But I charged him alſo with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſincerity</hi> in ſtating the Queſtion betwixt Catholics and Proteſtants,<note place="margin">Unſincerity.</note> and this alſo touches his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.

                  <p>That which I condemned in his ſtating of the Queſtion was,<note place="margin">§. 3.

                     <note place="margin">Proteſtants grant that Catholics hold all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</note> yet it do's not from thence follow, that Catholics reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally grant <hi>them</hi> alſo to hold the ſame.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he takes no notice of this Parallel, when given him in ſuch modeſt Terms, and ſtorms at the Method of giving it in the Diſſenters Language, which ſhews he has little to ſay to the Juſtice of the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But he tells me,<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> that I have miſtaken the <hi>Queſtion</hi> betwixt <hi>him</hi> and <hi>me:</hi> For his buſineſs was only to give <hi>a true Expoſition of the Doctrin of the Church of</hi> England.

                     <hi>he is but little concern'd in this Article;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. pag. 6.</note> neither is it (he ſays) his buſineſs to examin whether I have <hi>truly diſtinguiſhed</hi> betwixt that <hi>Honor</hi> which we pay to <hi>God,</hi> and that which we give to <hi>Saints.</hi> But really I think, conſidering the ſtreſs he has put upon the word <hi>ADORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,</hi> in his following Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">A neceſſary diſtinction not taken notice of by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</note> he ought to have taken notice of the diſtinctions which I here gave. But he knew that had he done this, all his Quotations out of our <hi>Liturgies,</hi> &amp;c. would have ſignified juſt nothing; neither could he have made ſo plauſible an excuſe for his <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Falſifications,</hi> and therefore he thought it better to leave the true Explication of the Terms, and the neceſſary diſtinctions betwixt <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Worſhip, Adoration</hi> and <hi>Adoration,</hi> &amp;c. to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and make uſe of them ſtill in his own confuſed Senſe, as if nothing had been ſaid to rectifie his miſtake.</p>
                  <p>I ſee then I muſt be forced to open the matter a little more plainly: Which having once done, I hope the Judicious Reader will take notice of what I ſay, tho' he who oppoſes me may not think it for his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I muſt again tell him with Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> that ſeeing in one Senſe <hi>Adoration, Invocation, and the Name of Mediator</hi> (I might add <hi>Juſtification, Prayer, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>are only proper to God and Jeſus Chriſt, it is no hard matter to miſapply thoſe Terms, whereby to render our Doctrin odious.</hi> And I muſt here conjure him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104173:20"/>not to obſtruct the hopes of a more Chriſtian Unity (which he thinks is now in a fair way to come on) by a future miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of thoſe Terms: To prevent which, I muſt deſire him to conſider,</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reſpect, Honor, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Service, Adoration, Veneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal terms and are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied by the Defender.</note> That tho' we would willingly appropriate peculiar Names or Expreſſions to ſignifie the intention with which we do our actions, calling that Honor which we pay immediately to God, Divine Adoration, or <hi>Latria;</hi> That which we pay to Men upon account of natural or naturally acquired Excellencies, only <hi>Civil;</hi> and that which we pay to Saints, Angels and Holy things, <hi>Doulia,</hi> or a <hi>Religious Honor,</hi> not in the ſtricteſt Senſe of the word, but becauſe it has a reference to <hi>God</hi> who is the <hi>Center</hi> of all <hi>Religious Honor,</hi> to whom it ought finally to tend, and in whom it is ultimately terminated; yet the Terms, <hi>Reſpect, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Worſhip, Service, Adoration, Veneration,</hi> &amp;c. have been ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly uſed by our Fore-fathers, both in our Native, and in the <hi>Sacred Languages,</hi> that it is impoſſible to make them ſpeak uniformly. Thus at this very day, tho' we affirm that <hi>God</hi> is only to be <hi>Worſhiped</hi> (meaning with <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi>) yet in the Proteſtant Common-Prayer Book, in the Ceremonies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the Man ſays to the Woman <hi>with my Body I thee Worſhip.</hi> And our Language teaches us to give the Titles of <hi>Worſhipful</hi> or <hi>Right-Worſhipful</hi> to Men of Quality. Thus in the Sacred Scriptures <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to Adore the Children of <hi>Heth, Joſue</hi> an Angel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid of words is likewiſe to be underſtood of the exterior actions of the Body, <hi>Bowing, Kneeling, Proſtrating,</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, I muſt deſire him to conſider with us,<note place="margin">§. 6. The Honor pay'd by thoſe words or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Object.</note> that this <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Kneeling, Proſtrating,</hi> &amp;c. theſe Terms of <hi>Veneration, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Worſhip, Honor,</hi> &amp;c. tho' ſo promiſcuouſly uſed, are yet diſtinguiſhed according to the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> on which they are <hi>Terminated;</hi> for if the Excellency be <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> or <hi>Extrinſical,</hi> as <hi>Nobility, Riches</hi> or the like, the Honor which is due is only <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Human:</hi> But where the Excellency is <hi>Supernatural</hi> we term the Honor <hi>Religious,</hi> that is, ſuch an Honor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104173:21"/>as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> teacheth. Now <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us alſo to make a diſtinction in <hi>Religious</hi> Honor, according as the Supernatural Objects themſelves are diſtinguiſhed. For the Supreme Independent Being is to be Worſhiped with a Sovereign unlimited Religious Honor, and this Honor which, (when we ſpeak ſtrictly) we call <hi>Latria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Divine honor called <hi>Latria</hi> only due to God.</note> is only due to him. But as God beſtows his Supernatural Gifts upon his Creatures, ſome in one degree ſome in another, ſo is there an Honor due to them according to their ſeveral Degrees; and tho' this Honor may be properly called <hi>Religious,</hi> becauſe of its Religious Motive,<note place="margin">Inferior honor called <hi>Doulia,</hi> may be given to Creatures.</note> and becauſe it has <hi>God</hi> for it's Ultimate Object, for whoſe ſake, and upon account of whoſe Gifts we Honor them; yet is it in a Degree Infinitely Inferior to that which we pay to <hi>God,</hi> becauſe the Object which it Regards is Infinitely Inferior to him. This Inferior Honor we (when we ſpeak in proper terms) call <hi>Doulia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The diſtination of <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Doulia</hi> is acknowledged by ſober Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to have its uſe, <hi>Voſtus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to be taken as no ds of art uſe to be taken to ſignifie peculiar conceptions in Chriſtianity.

                  </p>
                  <p>What if ſome of the Fathers believed that Saints departed were not admitted to the higheſt Heaven immediately upon their deceaſes? Do's not our Lord himſelf tell us, there are many Manſions in his Fathers Houſe; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that as the Stars do differ in Glory, ſo do the Saints in Heaven?

Certainly what ever ſenſe may be put upon the Primitive Fathers Writings, the conſtant practice and Tradition of the Church ſhews, that ſhe always believed ſome perſons to enjoy the Beatific Viſion immediately after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this life, tho there remains a further comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Glory at the general Reſurrection, when Soul and Body ſhall be united.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104173:26"/>
                  <p>What then if the few Writings of the Antients of the Firſt 300 years, which remain, be ſilent in this particular; does it follow, that they approved not the practice? or is there nothing now to be believed in the Church, but what muſt be found in their Writings? This indeed might be a Socinians plea: but I did not think thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as by law Eſtabliſhed) would have ſtood upon it, when an Act of Parliament obliges them <q>to Venerate the 4 firſt General Councils,<note place="margin">Stat. 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1.</note> ſo far as not to judge any matter or cauſe to be Hereſy, but ſuch as have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by the firſt 4 General Councils:</q> and when ſo many of their Writers endeavor to perſwade the People,<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Jewel,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> &amp;c.</note> that they are ready to ſtand by the Fathers of the firſt 400, 500, nay ſome of them 600 Years; that is, till the <hi>4th</hi> General Council incluſively.

                  <p>Had this Cuſtom of praying to Saints been only introduced in the <hi>4th</hi> Age, and been ſo dangerous as our Moderns endeavor to perſwade the World it is, certainly the ſucceeding General Councils would have taken notice of it, or ſome one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have written againſt it: But on the contrary, we find the<note n="*" place="margin">Planianus poſt merten vivit, Martyr pro nobis oret.

                  <p>His next Argument is,<note place="margin">§. 15. Defence p. 9.</note> That <hi>the Maxims of thoſe Antient Fathers concerning Prayer were ſuch, as are utterly repugnant to ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;</hi> ſeeing, <hi>they defined Prayer as due to God only;</hi> and made it their great Argument to prove <hi>our Saviour to be God, becauſe he was prayed to.</hi> This Argument ariſes, I am afraid, from an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected miſapplication of the word <hi>Prayer:</hi> So that tho' the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender know it well enough, yet I muſt tell the leſs circumſpect
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104173:27"/>Readers, that <hi>Prayer</hi> is a word which may be taken in a double Senſe: In one, it is <hi>only due to God,</hi> and in this Senſe it is,<note place="margin">An affected miſapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word Prayer.</note> that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> defines it, <hi>Elevatio mentis in Deum,</hi> an Elevation of the Mind to God; ſuch a Prayer as this being always payd as a debt due to our Bleſſed Saviour; it was a convincing proof againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> that he is God; and is ſo to this day againſt the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi> But taking Prayer, Invocation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in another Senſe, it is only due to Creatures; and of this nature, is that which we addreſs to Saints, deſiring them to <hi>Pray for us, help or aſſiſt us by their Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Akind of Prayer,</hi> ſays the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Advertiſement pag. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>which by it's own nature, is ſo far from being reſerved by God to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is an Independent Being, that it can never be Addreſſed to him:</hi> For we cannot without injury to God and Chriſt, Addreſs our ſelves to them with an, <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot think, but that this Author knew this well enough, but it ſerved his turn to make a Cry; and becauſe I did not then Anſwer ſuch frivolous Objections as theſe, he was willing ſome of his Learned Admirers ſhould think them unanſwerable. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other piece of the like Artifice is his bold pretenſions of what they have to ſay for themſelves; indeed (as he ſays) they have <hi>repeated things ſo often, that the World grows weary of them,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are nothing but what has been Anſwered and Objected, Objected and Anſwered, every year almoſt ſince the pretended Reformation.</p>
                  <p>But ſince he pretends they have ſuch clear proofs from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fathers;<note place="margin">§. 16. Proteſtants deſtitute of Scripture proofs againſt the Doctrin of Invocation of Saints.</note> he would have done well to have brought ſome convincing ones from either of them; ſuch I mean, as ſay it is, <hi>unlawful to deſire the Saints who Reign with God, to joyn their Prayers with ours;</hi> and not to affirm, that <hi>every Text of Scripture, that appropriates Divine Worſhip to God alone, is a Demonſtration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us,</hi> as if we gave <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> to the <hi>Saints;</hi> (which if he would ſpeak his Conſcience, he knows we do not, tho' he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as I hear, tells his Auditory we do:) Nor bring us paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture, which make nothing againſt us, unleſs he will always take <hi>Prayer, Invocation, Calling upon</hi> and <hi>Believing,</hi> in that ſtrict Senſe in which they are Duties, only to be pay'd to God. To ſay, <hi>we muſt Pray to God and God only,</hi> is a true Propoſition, if we take <hi>Prayer</hi> in that ſtrict notion; and ſo it is to ſay, <hi>we muſt Worſhip God and God only, Serve God and him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104173:28"/>only, Honor God and God only, Love God and God only, Fear God and God only;</hi> but ſeeing our Defender cannot deny, but that we may <hi>Worſhip, Serve, Honor, Love, Fear</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi> our fellow Creatures, with an Inferior Degree of <hi>Worſhip, Service, Honor,</hi> &amp;c. why may we not alſo make Inferior kinds of Addreſſes to them, ſuch as are far from robbing God of one Iota of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives?</p>
                  <p>What I have here ſaid, will be enough, I hope, to ſilence all thoſe cavils, that are raiſed againſt our Doctrin; but if nothing will do but Holy Writ, let him ſhew us thoſe plain Texts he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, till then we are in Poſſeſſion. A Poſſeſſion by his own, and our Adverſaries acknowledgment of above 1300 years, and by conſequence a Poſſeſſion which no Man in his wits would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his right to, becauſe this Author does not know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe Prayers and Addreſſes which are made to God, and thoſe Petitions which are made to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>What follows in the Appendix,<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> is grounded upon the ſame voluntary fixing the words, which are Equivocal to an Univocal Senſe.

                  <p>I ſay then, it is almoſt impoſſible any perſons, who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being inſtructed in the common Articles of our Faith, ſhould ſo wilfully and groſly err after ſuch inſtruction, as to give divine Honor to an Image, or to think any divine Vertue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, for which they ought to be adored. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Chriſtians at this day and the antient Heathens, or former Jews, is ſo great in this matter, that there is no Compariſon;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104173:31"/>for the Heathens were brought up in a Belief of a plurality of Gods; and the practice of adoring them was ſuch in thoſe days, that the Jews (who were apt to look upon nothing but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Happineſs,) ſeeing thoſe Nations proſper, who adored thoſe fained Deities, were ready to imitate their practices, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by that means to obtain the like temporal Bleſſings. But now ſince plurality of Gods hath been baniſhed from the World, the Jews themſelves, formerly ſo addicted to Idolatry, ſind not the leaſt Temptation to it. And for any one to think, that the moſt flouriſhing Chriſtian Church ſhould be guilty of it in her conſtant Practice, is ſuch a contradiction, that none but they who are willing to let themſelves be perſwaded of any thing, ſo it render thé Papiſts odious, can be guilty of it.</p>
                  <p>Yet the perpetual Clamor is,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> that Roman Catholics <hi>Kneel</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> before the <hi>Crucifix</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>bow, &amp;c.</hi> to them, and that muſt needs be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> I wiſh they who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us in that manner, knew what raſh judgment is, or reflected upon the puniſhment which God has reſerved for thoſe who are guilty of it; Raſh judgment, I ſay, which from an exterior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent action judges the inward intention to be wicked. I wiſh alſo they would reflect upon the nature of Idolatry,<note place="margin">The Nature of Idolatry.</note> and conſider that three things are required to make that Honor, which we pay to any thing, become Idolatrous. Firſt, the Underſtanding muſt acknowledge an Excellency in the Object truly Divine, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Adoration in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, where really there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch Excellency. Secondly, the Will muſt have a propenſion and inclination to it, as ſuch, and pay that Honor to it; And laſtly, the Body muſt pay the exterior Obeiſance of bowing, kneeling, proſtrating, kiſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in purſuance of that <hi>interior Love</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Now no Man can judge of this <hi>interior Affection</hi> to, or apprehenſion of the <hi>Objects Excellency,</hi> by the <hi>exterior action;</hi> becauſe thoſe exterior actions being common to many Objects, do not only ſignifie a different Reſpect, according to the dignity of the Object;<note place="margin">It is a raſh judgment to accuſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> but may alſo be uſed as well in ſigns of mockery, as in teſtimony of our Honor: Which we ſee they were when the Jews Adored our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>All Hale, King of the Jews.</hi> From whence it follows, that they who accuſe Catholics of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as Adorers of Images, muſt either pretend to know the Secrets of their hearts, when their manifeſt Declarations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

                     </note> So that the Croſs, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf here ſays, being an inſenſible Creature, deſerves no Honor, but only as it repreſents Chriſt, or is in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner one with him; in which manner the Honor which is pay'd to it, is pay'd to Chriſt, who is one with it; and by conſequence, that Honor, as being due to Chriſt, muſt be Divine. How much more Chriſtian and Scholar like, had it been for him to have ſearch'd into, and, according to Reaſon and Religion, explicated the words of this Holy and learned Doctor, whoſe Writings have been admired and reverenced by all the Chriſtian World, than ſo ungentilely to accuſe him of <hi>Reveries</hi> as he calls them? If our Defender had not underſtood how the Image is eſteemed to be one with the Object repreſented, or thought it to be a new and <hi>Sophiſtical</hi> Invention, he might indeed have been excuſed, (if he had confeſſed as much;) but when we find that explicating another Myſtery (after his Mode) he tells us, <hi>the KING and his IMAGE, are not TWO but ONE KING,</hi> one would think it ſhould not be ſo difficult a thing for him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand alſo, how <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Image</hi> are but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and how the <hi>Adoration,</hi> that is Paid to them, is but <hi>one Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to <hi>one Chriſt.</hi> Hear his own words; <hi>In a word, in the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion tho' there be two diſtinct Natures, God and Man, yet there is but one Perſon, one Son made up of both.</hi> So, <hi>In the Holy Euchariſt, tho' there be Two different things united, the Bread and Chriſts Body, yet we do not ſay, there be two Bodies, but one myſtical Body of Chriſt, made up of both; as the KING and his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAGE, to uſe the Similitude of the Antient Fathers, are not TWO, but ONE King,</hi> &amp;c. Which expreſſion is the very ground why St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Capiſucchi,</hi> &amp;c. maintain that Doctrin, as appears by the words of the Cardinal cited by the Defender, with the reaſon annexed to it, which he thought not fit to tranſcribe, but which I have mentioned in the Preface.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrin taken in this ſenſe, as paying nothing to the Image it ſelf,<note place="margin">See before in the Margent at.*</note> but only as it is one (in reſpect of it's repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) with the perſon whoſe Image it is; or if we ſpeak <hi>properly,</hi> with St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> taken not as if we <hi>adored the Croſs, but only
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104173:32"/>Chriſt Crucified upon it,</hi> and making uſe of the Croſs only to help us to call him to mind, and form in our Imaginations, the Image of him whom we ought to adore; this Doctrin I ſay, thus taken, is innocent, and they who hold it, are no more guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for making uſe of that material Image, than they who form one in their Imagination (either according to the Picture they ſaw laſt, or the Diſcourſe they heard or read) before which Idea they adore Chriſt repreſented by it, not diſtinguiſhing him from that Idea it ſelf, which is in ſome ſenſe one in it's repreſentative nature with him whom it repreſents. What neceſſity then is there that St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who as it is manifeſt intended that ſenſe, or the Pontifical, which ſpeaks in the ſame manner, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Idolatry? But this Scholaſtic nicety is not eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by every Doctor of the Populace; and therefore they muſt be made to believe, That Catholics hold the Croſs it ſelf (abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and in the groſſeſt manner) is to be adored as Jeſus Chriſt; otherwiſe they could not ſo eaſily make them paſs for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>This then may ſuffice concerning the Doctrin of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 24. The Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</note> as alſo in Anſwer to that Expreſſion taken out of the Rubric of the Pontifical, where it is mentioned, that the <hi>Legats Croſs muſt take place of the Emperors Sword; becauſe</hi> [Relativè] <hi>Latria is due thereto;</hi> yea alſo to that of the <hi>Meſſieurs du Port Royal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. pa. 24.</note> who ſpeak of <hi>adoring</hi> the Holy Thorn; In all which we may ſay with St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> as above, that there is ſome kind of Impropriety in the Speech, but ſuch as clears it ſelf by the application of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>His next Argument is taken from the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Benediction of a new Croſs. I told him he had mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated a Sentence, and left out two little words, <hi>Propter Deum, for Gods ſake,</hi> which would have ſufficiently anſwered his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.<note place="margin">A Falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> He cannot deny the Fact; but ſays, <hi>he left out others alſo as much to the purpoſe as theſe.</hi> I am ſorry, that he did. What amends does he make in this Defence? He troubles himſelf to give us an Abridgment of the Ceremony, and here and there picks up expreſſions which may ſeem ſcandalous to thoſe, who, like mortal Enemies, are reſolved to wreſt every word and action of their Adverſaries to an odious ſenſe, <hi>and at laſt</hi> magiſterially pronounces thoſe pious Ejaculations to be <hi>rather magical Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Does not every pious Preacher beg the ſame for the Diſcourſe he is about to make to the People? May not every Author of a devout Book beg of God, that he would <hi>give a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his Labors, that what he writes may be a ſaving Remedy to Mankind, that it may eſtabliſh the Faith of his Readers, excite them to the performance of Good works, aid them to work out their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be their Comfort and Conſolation, and arm them with Arguments of defence againſt the Suggeſtions of their Enemies?</hi> What Magic is there in all this? And why, I pray, may not we then beg the ſame for theſe <hi>Books of the unlearned,</hi> theſe Emblems, or if I may ſo call them <hi>Dumb Sermons,</hi> which as they are naturally apt to put us in mind of the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> will no doubt of it, by the aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, which we implore, animate us to perform thoſe Duties which are required of us in order to the <hi>application</hi> of our <hi>Ranſom.</hi>

And he who likes them not, 'tis feared would not have

                  <p>Well, but it may be that in the very Prayers this <hi>foul and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Idolatry</hi> is couched. Certainly he dare not affirm that, ſeeing they are immediately addreſſed to God himſelf, to beg of him <hi>a Bleſſing</hi> upon that Creature, and that he would impart <hi>the ſame Benediction to this Croſs that he did to that upon which he ſuffered,</hi> and grant that they <hi>who pray and bow down before this Croſs PROPTER DE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M, in honor of him who ſuffered upon it,</hi> may ſo call to mind his Paſſion, <hi>that they may find health both of Soul and Body through the ſame JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Oh, but after this Benediction <hi>the Biſhop, and as many as will of thoſe that are preſent, kneel down and devoutly ADORE it and kiſs it.</hi> Here I ſuppoſe is <hi>the foul and notorious Idolatry:</hi> But let him conſider their Intention. Is not all this, as well as the other, <hi>PROPTER DE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M, FOR GODS SAKE?</hi> 1. Is it foul and notorious Idolatry to kneel down before a <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>kiſs</hi> it in honor of that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> who <hi>ſuffered</hi> on it for our Salvation? 2. Or is it Idolatry to adore the Saviour of the world in preſence of the Croſs, if we ſpeak in a more proper ſenſe and according to the Eccleſiaſtical ſtyle? 3. Or laſtly, can he call it Idolatry to <hi>adore,</hi> that is, <hi>venerate</hi> (unleſs he will always fix an univocal ſenſe to an equivocal word) that which repreſents unto us the Bleſſed Author and myſterious manner of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? This would certainly render us Enemies of the <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and condemn them who <hi>kiſs</hi> the <hi>Bible,</hi> or <hi>kneel</hi> to their <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>God's vicegerents</hi> upon Earth; much more thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> who <hi>Adore God</hi> before the <hi>Altar</hi> in their Public Devotions and Communions.</p>
                  <p>But he has one Queſtion yet to ask of M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and that is; <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>looks upon the</hi> Croſs <hi>only as a</hi> memorative <hi>Sign; to what end is all this</hi> Conſecration, <hi>ſo many</hi> Prayers, <hi>ſhall I ſay, or rather</hi> magical Incantations? <hi>and how comes it to paſs, that a</hi> Croſs, <hi>without all this ado, is not as fit to</hi> call to mind Jeſus Chriſt who ſuffered upon the Croſs, <hi>as after all this</hi>

Do not you your ſelves uſe to ſet apart ſome Perſons, Things or Places to the Service of Almighty God, which were of themſelves after a ſort proper for that purpoſe, without ſuch a buſy Ceremony? and would not you, if a Diſſenter obſerving your Ceremonies in Conſecrating a Church, or a Biſhop ſhould tell you that what you do is <hi>Superſtition</hi> or <hi>magical Incantation,</hi> would not you, I ſay, eſteem ſuch expreſſions little leſs than Blaſphemy, and look upon ſuch accuſers as Ignorant and Malicious, not knowing what they ſay, or of what they affirm? If a Quaker, I ſay, ſhould ask you what need of ſo many <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Formalities,</hi> to bleſs a place for the <hi>Burial</hi> of the <hi>Dead?</hi> as if any Piece of Ground were not proper enough for that without ſuch Superſtition; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What is there I pray in all this Ceremony, (unleſs wreſted by ſuch Calumnies) which is not only good and holy in it ſelf, but wonderfully efficacious to ſtir up in all thoſe who are preſent, a true Senſe of our Bleſſed Saviours ſufferings upon that Good day for Us? What Chriſtian can call to mind the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Death his Redeemer that day ſuffered for the love of him, and not be ready to profeſs his gratitude by all the exterior Signs imaginable? Who is there, I wonder, that has any Senſe of his own former miſery, or grateful Affection for his Redemption, that can look (eſpecially on this day) upon the Reſemblance of his Crucified Saviour, and not feel his heart melt with compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, love, and a grateful acknowledgment for theſe Mercies? And at that time, what offence can it be, for his ſake, to Kiſs, to Embrace, to Reverence that Sacred Inſtrument, which calls thoſe Bleſſings to our remembrance? He, that Kiſſes the Picture of his Wife in her abſence, teſtifies the Conjugal Affection which he bears her, but is no Fool nor Idolater; and muſt he that Kiſſes the Crucifix in Teſtimony of the Love he bears to his Lord and Maſter, needs paſs for either? He who Kiſſes the Bible in Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Truths, that are there contained, will be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted a Pious Chriſtian; and muſt he be counted an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater, that Kiſſes the Reſemblance of him, who is the great Mediator of the New Teſtament?</p>
                  <p>The words, that are Sung by the Prieſt in the firſt part of the Action are, <hi>Behold the Wood of the Croſs, upon which the Saviour of the World did hang.</hi> And the whole Quire Kneeling down Sing, <hi>Let us Adore,</hi> not the Croſs <hi>in the ut moſt propriety of the phraſe</hi> as our Calumniator would have it, but the <hi>Saviour of the World, who hung upon it.</hi> Behold and ſee our Idolatry!</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>Prieſt, having layd the Croſs upon a place prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104173:35"/>the Altar, goes and puts off his Shoos, and Kneeling thrice Kiſſes it: And the reſt of the Clergy and Laics, two and two do the ſame:</hi> Theſe are uncouth and unuſual Ceremonies to Men, who have been eſtranged from Devotion. But what is it here, the putting off their Shoos, or the Kneeling, or the Kiſſing, that he brands with Idolatry? Yes, he knew all theſe exterior actions might eaſily be repreſented to the undevout Vulgar, as containing in them Horrid Superſtition and Idolatry, and therefore his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be managed with a reſpect to them.</p>
                  <p>But pray, good Sir, conſider, what our Intentions are by thoſe exterior Actions? Are they not to pay our Adorations to <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, who this day hung upon the Croſs;</hi>

It is evident, that by puting off our Shoos (a Ceremony which God Commanded once, and never repeal'd as yet, a Ceremony which ſpeaks an ardent Devotion, but no Superſtition) It is evident, by Kneeling and by Kiſſing of the Croſs, we intend no more to <hi>Adore</hi> that material Croſs, than <hi>Moyſes</hi> intended to Adore the Holy Ground on which he ſtood;<note place="margin">

Which if any ſhould practiſe now it would be counted Popery, tho' no Image were in ſight. But the caſe is this: As the Church of <hi>England</hi> in general for Gravity and Reverend behavior exceeds the Conventicles, or other Reformed Churches, ſo the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals of the Church we confeſs are more Solemn than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Churches, the Catholics, as 'tis fit, far beyond the Engliſh Cathedrals. And what is the iſſue? The Churches of <hi>England</hi> are cenſured as Superſtitious by the Kirkmen and Conventiclers; the Cathedrals are cenſured as ſuch by the Pariſh Churches; and the Catholic is cenſured alſo by the Reformed Cathedral: Still the more Solemn and Devout Church is cenſured for Idolatrous by the leſs. I ſhall ſhut up this with the following Story, whilſt I ask my Antagoniſt this Queſtion. Suppoſe he had been preſent in the City of<note n="c" place="margin">St. <hi>Athan.</hi> de Imagine Domint noſtri J. Chriſts qualiter Crucifixa eſt in Syria in urbe quae <hi>Berthus</hi> dicitur, Tem. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> B.</note> 
                     <hi>Berthus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> in St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his time, and had ſeen the <hi>Jews</hi> (as the ſame Saint relates) uſing all the Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to a Crucifix (which a Chriſtian had accidentally left behind him whilſt he removed from his Lodgings) that their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had done to our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf; would he not have looked upon thoſe actions as intended againſt our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and not terminated in that Wood? Would he not have condemned thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> as guilty of the ſame Crimes they were who Scourged him, Buffeted him, and Nailed him to the Croſs? Would he have excuſed them, becauſe they did thoſe actions to an inanimate Being? Or would he not rather have interpreted their intention, as paſſing from the Croſs to our Bleſſed Saviour,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104173:36"/>whom it repreſented? If he cannot deny, but that he ſhould have been concerned at theſe Indignities, or the like, which, as it is reported are done by the Renagado Chriſtians when ſubmitting to the Alcaron, they ſhoot at the Picture of our Saviour; I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould not in like manner interpret theſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Teſtimonies of our reſpect, not to terminate in the Crucifix, but to tend to him who ſuffered upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in our Days we have ſeen ſuch contempt ſhewn to the Images,<note place="margin">When Sir <hi>Will Wader</hi> burnt the Crucifix.</note> even of our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf in the publick Eye of the World, that the Enemies of Chriſtianity bluſhed for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, crying ſhame upon thoſe, who acknowledged him to be their God, and yet treated his Reſemblance with ſuch diſreſpect.</p>
                  <p>Now comes his laſt Argument, taken from the Hymns of the Church; and becauſe I ſaid, <hi>he had been often told,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 26. The Churches Hymns.</note> 
                     <hi>that there were Poetical Expreſſions in thoſe Hymns, and that the word <hi>Croſs,</hi> by a Figure ſufficiently known to Poets, ſignifies <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to whom we pray in our Hymns;</hi> he is brisk and confident, and has a mind to expoſe our <hi>Literature</hi> as well as our <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and tells me, he <hi>will not ask me by what Authority I ſend them to the Poets for interpreting the Churches Hymns: But if I pleaſe to inform them what that Figure is, which in the ſame place makes the Croſs, to ſignifie Chriſt, in which it diſtinguiſhes Chriſt from the Croſs, and who thoſe Poets are, to whom this Figure is ſufficiently known, I ſhall oblige them.</hi> Nay, he tells me, that <hi>they are amazed at the very report of ſuch a Figure, and believe it next a Kin to <hi>Cranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, I hope it is not a Crime in me to ſend him for the interpretation of the Church Hymns to the Poets, that made them. Poets I ſay, unleſs he will be ſo far an Hypocritic, as to deny <hi>Prudentius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> to be of that number. But if he look into his <hi>Corpus Poetarum,</hi> he will find them to have a place amongſt the other Poets; and if he look into their Works, he will find this very Hymn he boggles at; and it may be, if he caſt an Eye upon the Title of it, he will call to mind what Figure it is he there uſes (for I do not pretend that there is only one Figure in all the Hymns; ſometimes we find <hi>Metonymias,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Proſopopeias,</hi> and ſometimes others:) his Title is not <hi>de Cruce,</hi> of the Croſs, but <hi>de Paſſione Domini,</hi> of the Paſſion of our Lord: And if under the term Croſs he underſtand Chriſt and his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104173:37"/>ſufferings upon it, our Defender need not be amazed at it; nor endeavor to make the Figure by which it is done, ſo ridiculous: He will find it very familiar to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> I have told him already how that Apoſtle, when he gloried in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his ſufferings, ſaid,<note place="margin">

There's the Point. We ſay indeed, that it is neceſſary the free Will ſhould co-operate with the Grace of God, and that a perſon ſhould be diſpoſed by convenient preparations to receive that Grace; but ſtill we ſay it is a <hi>Grace</hi> which is given us <hi>Gratis,</hi> and as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the Council, which <hi>neither Faith nor good works which precede Juſtification could Merit for us.</hi>

                  <p>I Told him upon this Article, that the Niceties of the Schools,<note place="margin">§. 32. <hi>Vindic. pag.</hi> 48. Scholaſtic Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties to be avoided.</note> as they make no Diviſion in the Church, ſo ought they not to make any amongſt Chriſtians: But yet for all this, our Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt have recourſe to them, for want of better hold. The Opinions of <hi>Bellarmin, Vaſquez, Scotus,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be brought again, and their words quoted in the Margent, as if the whole ſtreſs of the cauſe lay there. But would he have conſidered what he was forced to acknowledge, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is againſt <hi>Scotus; Vaſquez</hi> againſt <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> &amp;c. and have reflected, that all of them were Catholics united in the Principles of one Faith, tho' diſſenting in theſe School Queſtions: I ſay, would he but have conſidered theſe things, he would have ſaved himſelf a great deal of pains; and his Readers much trouble: But he ſays, <hi>he recurred not to the Niceties of the Schools, but to the Expoſitions of our Greateſt Men; whoſe names were neither leſs, nor leſs deſervedly celebrated in their Generations, than M. de</hi> Meaux<hi>'s, or the Vindicators</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) <hi>can be now.</hi> No doubt thoſe perſons Names were, and are deſervedly Celebrated <hi>in Generationibus ſuis;</hi> and whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> may Challenge in the eſteem of the World amongſt theſe Celebrated Writers, the Vindicator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires only to reſt in his obſcurity. But to ſay, <hi>he recurred not to the Niceties of the Schools, but to the Expoſitions of our greateſt Men,</hi> is what may paſs in Diſcourſe or from the Pulpit, where no body contradicts him; but ſhould not have been expoſed to view in Print, becauſe it will not abide the Tryal. I never heard that theſe perſons writ direct <hi>Expoſitions</hi> upon the Council it ſelf, tho' they make uſe of it for the eſtabliſhment of their private opinions. And to ſay, he recurred not to the Niceties of the Schools,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104173:42"/>when he had recourſe to Merit <hi>de Condigno,</hi> and the various opinions of Catholic Divines upon that Queſtion, is ſuch a piece of Boldneſs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> having ſummed up the three opinions the Defender mentioned, and rejected the firſt and third, tho' he affirmed them to be far from Hereſie, ſays, he looks upon the middle Sentence to be the more probable. <hi>Nobis media ſententia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babiltor eſſe videtur,</hi> de Juſtif. lib v. c. 17. A. pa. 1122.

What I have already obſerved of the various opinions of Catholic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſummed up by thoſe Authors he mentions in the reſpective Chapters, is a ſufficient proof of what I ſay, and I ſhall not trouble my Readers with any other.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>the Council of Trent has</hi> (he ſays) <hi>ſpoken ſo uncertainly in this point,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§ 33.</note> 
                     <hi>as plainly ſhews, either they did not know themſelves what they would eſtabliſh, or were unwilling that others ſhould.</hi> How great pity it is ſo learned and ſincere a Cenſor as this Defender is, lived not in that Age, or aſſiſted not at that very Council! What is it they did not know? Was it the Doctrin of the Church concerning Merits? Or was it the Doctrin of the Schools? Neither the one, nor the other. But this he may ſay, and that truly, that they were not willing to enter into the particular diſputes of the Schools, nor to mix uncertainties, tho' of the higheſt probability with what they had been always taught to be of Faith: No wonder therefore, if they ſpeak not ſo poſitively in thoſe differences he propoſes, ſeeing they are not Doctrins of the Church, but the opinions of our Schools. I ſay therefore to him, that if he like not <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> nor the Cardinals opinion, pray let him follow that of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and he will be ſtill a Catholic as to that point.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Maldonate</hi> comes in: The Defender ſays, my Exception againſt his falſe Quotation is <hi>Impertinent.</hi> Why ſo, good Sir?

But to fly again to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> and bring them in, as affirming us to make a <hi>proper Satisfaction for our ſins,</hi> and that in ſuch Diſputes as they themſelves only call <hi>probable,</hi> avails little.

But the third,</hi> ſays he, <hi>videtur PKOB ASILIOR, ſeems more PROBABLE, that there is only one actual Satisfactian, and that ours; neither is Chriſt or his Sataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction excluded by this; for by his Saisfactian we have the Grace by which we ſathfy: And after this manner it is that Chriſts ſatisfaction is ſaid to be applied to us, not that his Sactification does immediately take away the temporal pain which is due to us, but mediately, that is, in as much as from is we receive Grace, without which our Satisfaction would have no value.</hi> How does this third Anſwer agree with our Defenders Propoſition?</note> when he grants there was an Error in the Preſs: And I doubt not, but all thoſe who read his <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and compare it with the <hi>Latin</hi> he now cites in the Margent, will excuſe me that I did not find it: for really he muſt be a more skilful Man in <hi>Languages,</hi> than I, that can find that Poſition, as he words it, in the place he cites: It would have been more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous to have given us the words of the Author at length, than by ſuch a turn as he has done, to make the Propoſition as it lies, neither <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Senſe, nor tenable.</p>
                     <p>I know the Doctrin of Satisfactions,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> was not the ſole pretence of their Separation, tho'. it was repreſented as one of the moſt neceſſary; But if it be proved, that this alone was ſo far from being a ſufficient ground, that it was no ground at all, and ſo of all other particulars; we muſt conclude, that all of them put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether could give no juſt cauſe for ſuch a Rent or Rebellion in the Church: I told him, that he ought to have given us ſome better Reaſon for his Aſſertion, that <hi>whenever God remits the Crime, he remits the Puniſhment,</hi> than <hi>we think ſo</hi> or <hi>we are perſwaded;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſeeing this Doctrin is of ſuch concern, that it gives more to a Sinner for ſaying a bare <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi>

No, no! the Defender certainly did not believe himſelf when he writ this, tho' he was

And would it not be a folly for any one to quit a poſſeſſion grounded upon ſuch Proofs, for a bare <hi>we ſuppoſe</hi> the Contrary?

And as for Antiquity, if they will not believe us, let them believe their own Proteſtant Authors, who are ſo little confident of the Fathers being on their ſide, that they accuſe them of Errors, not only in the Point of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but in almoſt all the Points in Controverſy, as has been ſully ſhewn by <hi>Brereley</hi> in his <hi>Proteſtant Apology,</hi> Firſt Part, and by ſeveral others.

For you (at leaſt as many of you as endeavour to make People confeſs their Sins to you) in giving Abſolution, do not only pretend to forgive the guilt of Sin, but by that forgiveneſs all the Pain that is due to it, even in the Court of God: Whereas all that is Univerſally received as of Faith in the Church concerning Indulgences, is,<note place="margin">What is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as of Faith.</note> that the Supreme Paſtor has power to Diſpenſe with Canonical Penances, and that only upon ſome juſt and ſufficient motive. As for the other part, the remiſſion of the Temporal Puniſhment due for the ſin, as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to God; tho' we have reaſon humbly to hope it may be mitigated, by our Confeſſion, Contrition, Almes-deeds and other Penitential Works enjoyned by thoſe Indulgences; yet is it not of Faith to believe they are taken away. And ſeeing this is piouſly believed, tho' not commanded as of Faith, and that we know the practiſing thoſe penitential Exerciſes, if they be not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial as to that Point, yet are they ſtill acceptable to God Almighty; therefore we deny not but the endeavoring to gain Indulgences by thoſe Religious actions pre-required in order to the remiſſion of the Pain due in the Court of God, may alſo be grateful to him. Theſe things being conſidered; and it being manifeſt, that what is of Faith in this Diſpute, has been the practice of the Primitive Church, I muſt again put the Defender in mind of his Promiſe,<note place="margin">The Deſ.

                     <p>Now to ſhew himſelf a Traveller, he tells us News,<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> that his Holyneſs has lately ſent an univerſal Indulgence throughout the whole Church, upon ſuch and ſuch ſtrange Conditions, which he repeats: And when theſe things are conſidered (ſays he) <hi>I doubt it will little avail the Vindicator to put me in mind of my Promiſe.</hi> Pray Sir conſider, what it is you ſo find fault with: Would it not really be a happy Day to ſee all the looſe People in <hi>England</hi> joyn with the devouter Party,<note place="margin">What a Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le is.</note> caſt themſelves at their Miniſters feet and there confeſs before God and him, their Sins and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, with a true hatred and deteſtation of them, and all for the love of God, with a reſolution of never committing the like
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104173:46"/>again; yea, forſaking the occaſions that induce to ſin, making a ſatisfaction to all thoſe whom they have injured, and forgiving thoſe who have injured them; after which, having alſo by a three days Faſt, with humble Prayer and Alms-deeds begg'd of God Almighty to avert his Indignation; would it not be to you a raviſhing Sight to ſee them all in this Equipage go and receive the Bleſſed Sacrament, and joyntly pray with Fervor and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the common Concerns of Chriſtendom, and the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Catholic Faith; would not this, I ſay, be a happy Sight? Certainly you cannot but wiſh that ſuch days were again in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch practices reſtored. And ſhould you live to ſee the Church of <hi>England</hi> practiſing ſuch Devotion, would you not be offended at any one who ſhould refuſe to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in the Court of Conſcience, the moſt enormous, if peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Sinners; or to remit the Canonical Penances upon ſuch a general account in order to their better life? Nay, further I may ſay, would you condemn any of yours, if to excite ſuch perſons to theſe pious practices, he ſhould aſſure them, that if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them with true Sorrow for their ſins, and a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God will reſtore them to the ſame ſtate they were firſt put into by Baptiſm; that is, free them, not only from the Guilt of ſin, but the Puniſhment alſo due to it? If it be your Principles that God never remits the Sin, but he remits the Puniſhment; why do you put it in the Margent as an Objection, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould promiſe ſuch Remiſſion to a Repentance accompanied with ſuch pious Exerciſes? If then it would be looked upon by you as a bleſſed Day to ſee ſuch Devotion in this one Nation, if you be in earneſt, what Joy muſt it be to every pious Soul to ſee the whole Chriſtian World proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Throne of Grace, and by ſuch practices endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to aſſwage his Anger?

                     <p>Tho' the eldeſt of the Councils I mention, was 1400 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; yet if he conſider that it was before Proteſtancy; that both the Eaſtern and Weſtern Biſhops in it conſented to that Decree; that the Acts of this Council were received by the much Major and Superior part of the whole Chriſtian World, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to a Practice delivered to them by their Fore-fathers, as of Faith; And withal, that this Council was ſeconded by another as Genreal as the circumſtances of Time could afford; I ſay,<note place="margin">This proof comprehends Scripture, Fathers, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and univerſal practice.</note> if he reflect upon theſe Heads, he will ſee that I was not hard put to it for Arguments, but that I compriſed them all in one, and ſending him to the Councils, I ſent him at the ſame time to Scripture, Fathers, Tradition, and the Univerſal Practice of Gods Church, upon all which their Deſintions were manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded.</p>

                  <p>As to the Argument I brought from his own Conceſſions;<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> tho' it was not ſo fully concluding as it might have been; yet let him anſwer me, Why they now continue the impoſition of Hands, if it was not left by the Apoſtles to be continued in the Church; and if it was left by them; for what end did they leave it, if not for the ſame, for which it was inſtituted, the giving of the Holy Ghoſt and Grace to confirm and ſtrongthen us in our Faith? And if the Euchariſt it ſelf do not certainly and infallibly give Grace to all thoſe that receive it, but only to them that receive it worthily; I ſuppoſe he will not expect any more from Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Let him therefore tell me, Whether, if a perſon duly prepared come to receive this Impoſition of Hands, the Grace of the holy Ghoſt does not certainly deſcend at that Holy Rite, for thoſe great ends the Prayers deſign? If theſe things be, as I think he can ſcarce deny them, he cannot deny alſo, but that this looks ſomewhat like a Sacramènt. But if (as he ſays) this be <hi>only a meer indifferent Ceremony, continued only in imitation of the Apoſtles, and to which no Bleſſing is aſcribed, that may not equally be allow'd to any other the like Prayer,</hi> Why might not this Prayer be reiterated as well as others? Why muſt this Ceremony be only allowed to be performed by Biſhops? and why are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo much exhorted not to neglect it?</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104173:50"/>of Hands, which we call Confirmation, is a Sacred ſign of an Interior Grace, given with the Holy Ghoſt to the Faithful: I might have ſhewn him Ten Popes, the laſt of which was no leſs than St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, all of them affirming the Holy Ghoſt, or his Gifts, to be given by this Sacrament; ſome of them calling it a great Sacrament, and others mentioning both Chriſm and Impoſition of Hands: I might have ſhewn him no leſs than three General Councils, and eight others on our ſide; ſome of them very antient: I might have ſhewn him alſo nine Greek Fathers, and as many of the Latin, of which St. <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> are the laſt; all whoſe Teſtimonies are ſo full, that our Defender will be ill at eaſe to give a civil Anſwer.

And call you this a Reformation, which ſeems to be more careful of the Dignity of the Paſtor, than of the Salvation of the Flock? I think the Defender would do well to conſider this, and perhaps he will be aſtoniſhed at their own proccedings.</p>
                  <p>I told him, this Doctrin was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> together with Chriſtianity, by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and the Benedictin Monks; and that if he would have us to relinquiſh it, he muſt bring us, either ſome manifeſt Revelations or demonſtrative Reaſons, for nothing elſe could induce us to quit a poſſeſſion of ſo long ſtanding: But he knew this would be impoſſible for him to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolved to keep at diſtance, and put us upon the proof: A proceeding which would not hold in Law, where an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poſſeſſion is a ſufficient Evidence:<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ricau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>ART. XII.</hi> Of Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</head>
                  <p>IF the Defender had rightly conſidered the Queſtion betwixt us,<note place="margin">§. 51. The Defender miſtakes the Queſtion.</note> he would have ſpared a great part of the pains he has taken in this Article, and have let alone the pretended Proofs he brings from our Antient Liturgies, as wholy impertinent.</p>
                  <p>Tho's he could not deny, but that in Extream Unction there is both an outward Viſible Sign, and an inward and Spiritual Grace annexed to it; yet becauſe he was to oppoſe the Catholic Church, he would have this to be only a Ceremony made uſe of in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures of the Apoſtles: And to prove this, he affirmed, that the Antient Rituals of the Roman Church for 800 Years after Chriſt, ſhew the practice to have had the primary reſpect to Bodily Cures, and that Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> himſelf freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the words of St. <hi>James</hi> could belong to no other; and from thence concluded, they had reaſon to leave off this Extream Unction, becauſe Miracles are now ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this,<note place="margin">A Falſification of <hi>Cajetan.</hi>
                     </note> I told him; Firſt, that Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> did not poſitively ſay, as he affirmed he did. But what if he had? Would it be ſufficient to reject a practice coming down from the Apoſtles, and from Age to Age, viſibly continued in all Chriſtian Churches, both of the Eaſt and Weſt for 800 Years, as he himſelf confeſſes, notwithſtanding that the Gifts of Miracles were ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this upon the Teſtimony of one Mans affirming, that it cannot be proved from that Text of Scripture? What if it may be proved by the Univerſal Practice and Tradition of the Church, is not that Practice and Tradition the beſt Interpreter? muſt that be laid aſide, becauſe a <hi>Cajetan,</hi> or ſome few perſons in theſe latter Ages, think St. <hi>James</hi> in that paſſage, had an Eye to the miraculous Cures of the Apoſtles, when it is moſt likely, the Unction mentioned by the Holy Evangeliſt St. <hi>Mark</hi> had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, at leaſt as a Figure, to this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">§. 52. It has a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cures.</note> As to the Antient Rituals, I told him, that ours alſo agree with them, that this Sacrament has a reſpect to bodily Cures, as well as thoſe of the Mind; and therefore I told him, that unleſs he could manifeſtly prove, that the Unction mentioned by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104173:52"/>St. <hi>James,</hi> and practiſed by the Primitive Church for the firſt 800 Years, had no relation to the Sickneſs of the Soul, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; but only to the Body, in order to miraculous Cures: He would prove nothing againſt us, who acknowledge, that the Sick perſons do many times by it obtain health of Body, when it is expedient for the Salvation of their Souls. But this he ſaw was impoſſible: However ſomething muſt be ſaid, tho' to no purpoſe; and therefore to make the unwary Reader think he had much the better on it, St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> Ritual, and the other antient Forms uſed in the Greek and Latin Church for 800 Years, muſt be quoted at large, and all the paſſages in them, that tend to the Cures of the <hi>Body,</hi> varied in a different Character; but where the <hi>Mind</hi> is concerned, the ordinary Character muſt ſerve; and thence as wild a Concluſion muſt be drawn, that this Unction had more than a <hi>bare reſpect to bodily Cures;</hi> nay, that it was <hi>eſpecially,</hi> or (as he ſaid before) <hi>primarily deſigned for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How! did the Greek and Latin Churches for the firſt 800 Years practiſe this Unction; and do Proteſtants,<note place="margin">§. 53.</note> who pretend to reform according to the Primitive purity reject it? Yes, but They practiſed it with a primary reſpect to Bodily Cures, and we to thoſe of the Soul.<note place="margin">Sanctiſying Grace, Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance againſt Temptations, and Remiſſion of Sin, are the Primary Effects.</note> No wonder if we call Sanctifying Grace, Aſſiſtance againſt Temptations in the laſt Agony, and Remiſſion of Sin, the primary effects in Dignity, whilſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Cure may be the primary in Order, and only with reſpect to the other. But how does he prove, that the Unction uſed by the Primitive Chriſtians for the firſt 800 Years, reſpected mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Cures only? All the Prayers and Ceremonies, ſays he, ſhew it. And do they not alſo ſhew a reſpect to thoſe of the Soul? Is there not mentioned a <hi>Tutamen mentis,</hi> as well as <hi>Corporis,</hi>

                  <p>Again; How had theſe a reſpect to miraculous Cures only, when the Fathers of thoſe Times tell us, that ſuch Miracles ceaſed preſently after the Apoſtles Times? Does not their practiſing of this after the ceſſation of thoſe Miracles, ſhew that they expected an <hi>interior Aſſiſtance of the Soul,</hi> rather than a <hi>miraculous Cure of the Body?</hi> Well might I therefore tell him, that his ſenſe of the words of St. <hi>James,</hi> and of the intention of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Unction, was contrary to what we were taught by all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                  <p>I told him alſo,<note place="margin">§. 54.</note> that the very words of St. <hi>James</hi> evinced it. And I have heard of ſome Proteſtant Anabaptiſts, that think ſo, and therefore uſe it.<note place="margin">Luther.</note> However he knows who they were that threw off the Epiſtle, partly upon that account. <hi>Infirmatur quis in vobis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The words of St. <hi>James</hi> Evince it.</note> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>If any one,</hi> or <hi>whoever is Sick amongſt you.</hi> The words belong to all Chriſtians: But if he had ſpoken of miraculous Cures only, he needed not have invited them; their own Wants would have perſwaded them ſufficiently to ſend for thoſe who had the Gift of Miracles, as the Centurion ſent to our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inducat Presbyteros Eccleſiae: Let him bring in the Prieſts,</hi> the Clergy, the Ordinary ſtanding Rulers of the Church, of which, as I told him, <hi>All had not the Gift of Healing;</hi> and ſome, who were not of the Clergy, had it. 'Tis manifeſt then, the Apoſtle would have ſaid, ſend for thoſe who have the Gift of Healing, be they Clergy or Lay perſons, had he ſpoken of miraculous Cures only. But ſays the Defender, if all had it not, 'Tis very like St. <hi>James</hi> meant, They ſhould be ſent for that had it; whereas firſt, this is clear againſt the Text, which ſpeaks at Large, ſend for the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104173:53"/>Prieſts. Secondly, It would have been to no purpoſe,<note place="margin">Defence <hi>pag.</hi> 44.</note> ſeeing by his own Confeſſion, they who had the greateſt meaſure of thoſe Gifts, could not exerciſe them when they would, but only when the Spirit of God inſtructed them. And laſtly, Seeing he aſſures us, that they never attempted thoſe miraculous Cures, but when the ſame Spirit taught them, that the ſick perſon had Faith to be healed, and that it would be to the Glory of God to do it; I deſire he would at his leiſure let us know how it came to paſs, that the Primitive Chriſtians exerciſed this Extream Unction (if it tended only to miraculous Cures) after Miracles were ceaſed. For it is manifeſt, that if they never did, or if it were unlawful for them to uſe this anointing with Oyl for miraculous Cures, but when the Spirit of God dictated to them that they ſhould be healed; this Extream Unction mentioned by St. <hi>James,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practiſed for the firſt 800 Years, moſt of which Time there was few ſuch Miracles wrought, cannot be that miraculous Unction of which he ſpeaks. When therefore St. <hi>James</hi> adds, <hi>let them Pray over him, anointing him in the Name of the Lord,</hi> he ſpeaks of an ordinary diſpenſation, and gives us hopes of the effect.</p>
                  <p>I told him, <hi>Miraculous Cures were wrought in the Lame and the Blind,</hi> but the Apoſtle includes not them. Here to ſhew his Learning, he tels us, that the Greek word may include them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But does the Apoſtle ſpeak of ſuch as are well and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whole, as we ſay the Lame and the Blind may be, ſuch as do not keep their Beds; or does he not rather ſpeak of Decumbents in Sickneſs in your own ſenſe? for they only can be <hi>raiſed up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I added, that the Power of <hi>Miracles</hi> was not tied to Unction only. From whence it followed, that if the Apoſtle had only ſpoken of <hi>miraculous Cures,</hi> he would not have limited them to that Ceremony. But the Defender thinks this was the ordinary Sign, the moſt common and frequent amongſt them; and grounds his thoughts upon St. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. But the Evangeliſt only tels us there, that the Apoſtles did <hi>anoint many ſick people, and cure them:</hi> But ſeeing the ſame Holy Evangeliſt, <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18. tells us, that Chriſt promiſed, that thoſe who believed in him, ſhould <hi>lay their Hands upon ſick people and heal them;</hi> why may not this Impoſition of Hands be looked upon as no leſs common and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; nay, more frequently uſed in thoſe miraculous Cures,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104173:54"/>than Unction, becauſe, more ready, and eaſy to be performed upon any occaſion? And if ſo, had the Apoſtle intended only to invite perſons not to neglect thoſe miraculous Cures, by our Authors Argument, he ſhould have mentioned that Impoſition of Hands.</p>
                  <p>I told him further, that <hi>all thoſe that were anointed, were not cured.</hi> But this he ſays, is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>diſhonorable to the Spirit by which they acted.</hi> How! were all thoſe that were anointed for the firſt 800 Years cured? If not; let him tell us when thoſe miraculous Cures ceaſed, and why the Spirit of God, which, he ſays, <hi>taught them when they ſhould anoint, and when they ſhould not,</hi> did not alſo teach them to diſcontinue the Practice of it, when the Church needed not Miracles to confirm her Doctrins; and how it is that Proteſtants are become ſo learned at preſent, as to reject it after above 1600 Years perpetual practice.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I ſaid, that <hi>all thoſe who were cured by them that had the Gift of Healing, had not an aſſurance by that cure, of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of their Sins.</hi> This again, he ſays, is <hi>falſe.</hi> From which and the foregoing Aſſertion it would follow, in our Defenders ſenſe, That no perſons either died or were damned, that had this Extream Unction given them, till the Spirit of God left the Church, and ſhe fell into an Error, uſing it with a primary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Soul, when God had inſtituted it only for miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cures. And therefore I had reaſon to tell him, that if St. <hi>James's</hi> expreſſion <hi>(the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up)</hi> had been meant of bodily Health, thoſe only would have died in the Apoſtles Time (I might have added, as long as the Church underſtood that paſſage in his ſenſe, which he thinks was for 800 Years) who either neglected this Advice, or whoſe Deaths prevented the accompliſhment of this Ceremony. An argument, which becauſe he could not anſwer, he was willing to throw Duſt in his Readers Eyes, by retorting of it, and telling us, that <hi>if it were to be underſtood of the Souls Health, it would follow, that none were damned, either then or now, but they who neglect this Advice, or whoſe Deaths prevent the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this Sacrament:</hi> Of the Truth of which he deſires my Opinion. I anſwer him, That it is a Truth never doubted of in the Church, that all thoſe who receive this Sacrament with due preparation, and in that ſtate which is required, as neceſſary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104173:54"/>by the Curch, and fall not into new mortal ſins before their Deaths, are ſaved. And if he do but conſider, that the Church requires the perſon who rightly receives this Sacrament, ſhould be in the ſtate of Grace, it being one of thoſe which only aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Grace, but does not reſtore it when loſt, he will reſt of this Opinion.</p>

                  <p>But let him tell us plainly;<note place="margin">§. 58.</note> Is Marriage nothing but a civil Contract? and that of perſons unbaptiſed, of equal perfection, and as indiſſoluble as that of Chriſtians? Upon what account is it in the Law of Grace made Inſeparable, and tyed to one and one, if it neither ſignify the Union betwixt Chriſt and his Church; nor have a Grace annexed to it to enable perſons to overcome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable difficulties which attend that ſtate, and poſſeſs their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) in Sanctification and honor, and not in paſſion of Luſt and Ignominie, to preſerve Conjugal Chaſtity in Sickneſs and neceſſary Abſence, to ſweeten cohabitation, and to enable them to bring up their Children in the Faith and Fear of God? For our parts we acknowledge Gods Mercy in giving a Grace in this Sacrament for thoſe great ends:<note place="margin">Marriage is grown con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in <hi>England,</hi> ſince it was denied to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> But it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome learned Men, that in this little time ſince Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was diſowned for a Sacrament, there has been more Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, Diſquietudes, Adulteries, Suing for Divorces and Alimony, and more Petty Treaſons, (that is, Murdering of Husbands) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> than was to be heard of many hundred of Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104173:56"/>and what other, do you gueſs, ſhould be the reaſon of this, but the neglect of that Grace which God is ready to confer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who prepare themſelves aright for this Sacrament, and the looking upon it only as a civil Contract.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more the Defender is angry at,<note place="margin">§. 59. It is proved from St. <hi>Paul. Eph.</hi> 5.32.</note> that is, that I ſhould ſay, <hi>we have plain Texts of Scripture for us as interpreted by the Fathers.</hi> I need not bring any other than that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who having exhorted married perſons to <hi>love one another, as Chriſt loved his Church,</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>two in one Fleſh,</hi> tels them, <hi>this is a great <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but I ſpeak in Chriſt and in the Church,</hi> which words ſhew plainly what I have already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that Marriage is truly a Sacrament in the Church and in Chriſt, tho' it be only a civil Contract out of it. It is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inſtituted by Chriſt to repreſent the indiſſoluble Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his Church, and therefore has his Grace annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, that it might truly repreſent that Union; for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Marriage does not well repreſent it, nor one that may be diſſolved. But here the modern Innovators, after <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> cry out the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a falſe Tranſlation, the Greek word being <hi>Myſtery:</hi> But this is only a Trick of Proteſtants, who as they were wont in their firſt Bibles to leave out the word <hi>Church,</hi> whereever they met with it in Scripture, and put in <hi>Congregation;</hi> becauſe the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> would bear that ſenſe: ſo here, becauſe the Greek has no other word but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> to expreſs a <hi>Sacrament</hi> and a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> therefore it muſt be rendred <hi>Myſiery,</hi> leſt their People ſhould with their Forefathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Marriage</hi> to be properly a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> But certainly they who are not willing to be impoſed upon, will rather follow the Interpretation of all the antient Fathers and Commentators up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place, who unanimouſly agree, that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe was, that <hi>Matrimony</hi> is properly a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that a great one, becauſe it ſignifies the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> than theſe novel Criticks.</p>
                  <p>Indeed where perſons have a mind to cavil, there is no Text of Scripture ſo plain, but may be wreſted to a different ſenſe; and therefore we are forced, upon thoſe occaſions, to fly to the Tradition of the Church,<note place="margin">By Univerſal Tradition of the Greek and Latin Churches.</note> and the unanimons conſent of thoſe Interpreters who lived before that Diſpute aroſe. And thus it is no wonder, that <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſhould ſay, we have not any Text of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104173:56"/>Scripture that <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>evidently</hi> proves this Doctrin, without having recourſe to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But when this Tradition is ſuch, that not only the antient Fathers, as St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Theophilact,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and generally all Commentators, till <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> agreed in it; but alſo the whole <hi>Church,</hi> both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> conſented to it, as appears, not only by the general conſent of all their Divines for the laſt 600 Years, but by the Definitions of Councils held ſince that time; and particularly that of <hi>Florence,</hi> where the Greek and Latin Fathers were agreed upon this point; as alſo by the Teſtimony of <hi>Hierimias Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who in his own name, as Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Bellarmin. de M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>One thing more remains,<note place="margin">§. 60. Marriage not neceſſary for every one.</note> which has been thought a witty Objection againſt the Church; that ſhe makes Matrimony a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and yet denies it to her Clergy; for a <hi>Sacrament</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt be Generally neceſſary to Salvation;</hi> But this is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a forced Principle, taken up upon begging the Queſtion about the number of the Sacraments; and beſides is not ſo heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Two which Proteſtants pretend to maintain; For the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (for any thing yet appears) are not much perſwaded of any ſuch great neceſſity (I ſpeak not of what they call Superſtitious <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> but) even of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> it ſelf for dying perſons: For unleſs they can get company to Communicate beſides the Decumbent, he muſt lye in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and venture into the other World without his <hi>Viaticum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Churches ſcrupling Marriage to her Clergy, it is a difficulty to thoſe who conſider not the Sanctity of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: If there be any ſtate more perfect than another, I hope it belongs to the Prieſt; but the ſtate of Marriage is more imperfect than the ſtate of a reſolved Virginity, (as you dare not deny) ſhall not the Church than give leave to her Hierarchy (who are, or ought to be the moſt perfect) to degrade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amongſt the conjugate, when ſhe always maintained an
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104173:57"/>order of Virgins even in the weaker female Sex; or rather may ſhe not direct them to follow the Evangelic counſel of being Eunuchs for the Kingdom of God? But I will not dilate upon this. The Church appoints her Sacraments where they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. She does not appoint Marriage for all, nor Extream Unction to the Luſty, nor Holy Orders to every one. You make a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſcruple the uſe of Marriage at ſome ſolemn times (if you diſſemble not;) and the Church upon the ſame reaſons ſcruples Marriage it ſelf to ſome certain Orders of Men.</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>All the Authority Impoſition of Hands has in Scripture, is only the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of three or four places, where it was practiſed indeed, but no where commanded.</hi> See how ſome Men can digeſt any thing. Are not three or four places of Holy Scripture ſhewing the Practice of it, a ſufficient Teſtimony that it was commanded? Were the Apoſtles for will-worſhip, uncommanded Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; did they things on their own Head without their Lords Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or his leaſt Innuendo? My Adverſary thinks, it ſeems, that nothing is commanded, but what he can read commanded; No unwritten Tradition now with him. At other times perhaps hee'l grant there may be ſome: But now we read not: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas we read not any Command by Chriſt for the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Day, only three or four Examples of the practice of it, that is <hi>all the Authority,</hi> &amp;c. If Scripture be his rule of Faith, let him ſhew us a greater authority then the example of three or four places contradicting our Tenets, and he will have reaſon to Diſpute with us.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe of our own, who (as he ſays) maintain that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands, is not eſſential to Holy Orders; if they be not worth his naming, they are not worthy my concern: We are not to anſwer for the particular Sentiments of Scholaſtics, as I have often told him.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:104173:58"/>
                  <p>But <hi>the Grace conferred is no Juſtifying Grace; nor by conſequence, ſuch as is requiſite to make a true and proper Sacrament.</hi> Thus our Defender: Whereas in his Expoſition he acknowledged, that <hi>Impoſition of Hands in Holy Orders is accompanied with a Bleſſing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> A <hi>Bleſſing</hi> do you ſay? and why not a <hi>Grace,</hi> ſeeing St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly calls it ſo,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note> admoniſhing St. <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>ſtir up the Grace of God, which was given him by the Impoſition of his Hands;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.14.</note> and in another place exhorting him not to <hi>neglect the Grace in him, which was given him by Prophecy</hi> [that is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the particular revelation made to St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning him] <hi>with the Impoſition of the Hands of Prieſthood?</hi> He goes on. If it may be called a Grace,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Expoſ.</hi> ibid.</note> yet not <hi>a Grace common to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans —but only a ſeparation of him who receives it to a ſpecial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy:</hi> And therefore we think <hi>it ought not to be eſteemed a common Sacrament of the whole Church, as Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper are.</hi> Pray Sir, who ever ſaid, that the <hi>Grace, which is given in Holy Orders, is a Grace common to all Chriſtians;</hi> or that it is <hi>a common Sacrament of the whole Church?</hi> Is it not ſufficient for a Sacrament that it be the viſible ſign of an inviſible Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon ſome particular perſons, ſegregated to a ſpecial employ for the benefit of the whole Church? muſt all perſons be Deacons, all perſons Prieſts, all Biſhops, or elſe Holy Orders no Sacrament? Oh, but <hi>it is not a Juſtifying Grace.</hi> What do you mean by a Juſtifying Grace? Is not this Grace given in Holy Orders, a Grace that renders the perſons who receive it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God Almighty, and enables them to perform the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to which they are called? Does not this Sacrament confer at leaſt an increaſe of Sanctifying Grace, tho' it be not inſtituted to confer the firſt Grace of Remiſſion of Sin? If you will have nothing elſe to be a juſtifying Grace, but what is inſtituted pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily for the Remiſſion of Sin, I am afraid you will hereafter conclude the Euchariſt to be no Sacrament, becauſe it does not primarily confer ſuch a Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, the whole buſineſs of our Defender is nothing but Shifts. If it may be called a particular Sacrament, yet is it not common to the whole Church; If a Grace be given in it, yet not a ſanctifying Grace, a Grace common to all Chriſtians; If we find three or four places in Scripture mentioning Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands in order to the conferring of ſome Grace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104173:58"/>ever it be; yet we do not find it commanded. What is all this but puttings off, and a begging the Queſtion, by ſuppoſing, that nothing can be truly a Sacrament, which is not General to all Chriſtians? But I am afraid I have been too long upon theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, ſeeing the Next great Article challenges an exact Examen.</p>

For either Chriſt. who is God and Man, is there body and Soul and Divinity; or he is not there.</p>
                     <p>If then he be preſent in the bleſſed Sacrament, he muſt be either really preſent, which cannot be, unleſs his Body and Blood and Soul and Divinity be there really and ſubſtantially; or he muſt be there only morally or figuratively, as ſignified by the exterior Signs of Bread and Wine, and by them beſtowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us the benefits which he purchaſed for us by taking our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on him.</p>
                     <p>Now Jeſus Chriſt may be really,<note place="margin">§. 65. He may be really preſent after different manners.</note> eſſentially and Subſtantially preſent in a place, after different manners.

His body was <hi>ſown a Corruptible Body; but is now raiſed a Spiritual Body;</hi> yet is this Spiritual Body eſſentially and ſubſtantially the ſame with that which was once corruptible, tho' it was never to ſee Corruption.</p>
                     <p>All Perſons,<note place="margin">§. 66. All agree that Chriſt is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Catholics and <hi>Lutherans</hi> that he is really preſent, but not after a natural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> both Catholics and Proteſtants, acknowledge that Jeſus Chriſt is morally or figuratively preſent in the Sacrament; that is, that the outward elements ſignify his Body and Blood; that a lively Faith apprehends him there preſent; and that he beſtows upon the worthy Communicants the Graces purchaſed for us by his becoming Man, and dying upon the Croſs. But Catholics and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> agree further in this, that Jeſus Chriſt (that is God and Man, Fleſh and Blood, Soul and Divinity) is not only morally there, but alſo truly, really and ſubſtantially preſent in the Bleſſed Sacrament; tho' they both of them deny him to be there <hi>circumſcriptivè</hi> as the Schools call it, that is, in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104173:59"/>his Natural Body after a natural manner, with reſpect to place. Their chief difference conſiſts in this, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> will have him to be ſo preſent, that Bread is alſo preſent with him (which Catholics deny) and tho' they pretend to ſubmit their Faith to the acknowledgment of his real preſence, which they do not ſee; yet will they follow Senſe ſo far, as to judge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee the appearance of Bread to remain, that is is really Bread alſo; when the Subſtance of Bread is as inviſible,<note place="margin">The <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp;c. ſay he is only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively there.</note> as that of the Body of Chriſt. The <hi>Zuinglians, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. admit nothing at all of <hi>real</hi> here. The preſence which they ſpeak of, is only figurative, ſignified by the Bread and Wine: ſo that as they ſee the Bread broken, eaten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Wine poured out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ought they to call to mind, that Chriſt's Body was Crucified and torn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for us; which whil'ſt they reflect upon and receive, they are by Faith (or a ſtrong Fancy) made partakers, as they think, of the Benefits of that his Death and Paſſion, the Bleſſings which the offering of his Body may procure.</p>

                     <p>This is the Doctrin we are invited to believe, which how inconſiſtent it is with it ſelf, appears to every one who rightly apprehends the Terms of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Figurative.</hi> Let us now ſee what is the Doctrin of Roman Catholics.</p>

The Roman Catholic Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</note> that <hi>becauſe Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer did truly ſay, that that was his Body which he offered under the ſpecies of Bread; therefore it was always believed in the Church of God; and this Holy Synod does now again declare it, that by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of Bread and Wine there is made a converſion</hi> (or change) <hi>of the whole ſubſtance of Bread into the ſubſtance of the Body of Chriſt and of the whole ſubſtance of Wine into the ſubſtance of his Blood; which change is conveniently and properly called by the Catholic Church Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the ſame<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ib. can. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> Council pronounces an <hi>Anathema againſt all thoſe who ſhall deny the Body and Blood together with the Soul and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be truly, really, and ſubſtantially contained in the Holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt, or that ſhall affirm it to be there only as in a Sign or in Figure or Vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we believe a true, real, and ſubſtantial preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, that is, of his Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity. The Lutherans agree with us in it, but will have Bread to remain too, which we deny. And the Calviniſts ſeem at leaſt in words to confeſs the ſame, but will have the preſence to be Spiritual, by which (as I told them) if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only that Chriſts preſence is not there after a natural, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, corporeal, extenſive manner, we admit of it; but if they mean by this ſpiritual manner, that Chriſt, who is both
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104173:61"/>God and Man, is not truly, really, eſſentially, ſubſtantially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we deny it.</p>
                     <p>They who affirm,<note place="margin">§. 71. Three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> as we do, that Chriſts Body is really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament, Propoſe ſeveral ways by which they think it may be done, all which may be reduced to Three. Firſt, that his Body may be preſent together with the Bread; as Fire is together with Iron, when red hot, Water with Aſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, preſent ſo as that the Bread remaininig Bread, is alſo the true Body of Chriſt. Or Thirdly, that the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt ſhould be there, the Subſtance of Bread ceaſing to be. As to the firſt, the words of the Inſtitute are againſt it; For if Chriſt had rendred his Body preſent after that manner, he would not have ſaid <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> but <hi>Hîc eſt corpus meum, Here is my Body.</hi> The ſecond manner is acknowledged by Engliſh Proteſtants to be wholy impoſſible, as implying a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Contradiction, that it ſhould be Bread and not Bread, the Body of Chriſt and not the Body of Chriſt. The third is the true Catholic Doctrin, and is called by the Church <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that is, a Converſion of the whole ſubſtance of Bread into the true Body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the Blood, as I have mentioned from the Council. And thus Chriſt is really preſent in the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Now this exiſtence of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament, is not after a natural, corporeal, extenſive manner, becauſe it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible nor palpable: But yet for all this the ſame ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Body may be really preſent after a ſpiritual manner in the Sacrament. We have Examples of this from Holy Writ; For if we doubt not, but that he could free his Body from being viſible, palpable, and heavy, and could make it ſo ſpiritual as to paſs from his Virgin mothers Womb, without breach of her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, and through the Doors when ſhut, can we doubt his Power in rendring it preſent, without local extenſion, or the other qualifications of a common natural Body? And tho' this preſence cannot be called ſpiritual in a ſtrict ſenſe, yet may it be ſo called in that ſenſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes, when he tels us, that the Body is <hi>ſown a corruptible Body, and is raiſed a ſpiritual Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to thoſe ſeeming Contradictions of a Bodies being preſent in more places than one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Firſt we affirm them to be no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104173:61"/>Contradictions; A contradiction being an Affirmation and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſame thing in the ſame time, place, manner, and and all other circumſtances, but ſuch an Affirmation and Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not made of Chriſts preſence in ſeveral Hoſts.<note place="margin">See the Guld in Controverly, <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104173:62"/>conclude, that Jeſus Chriſt gave his Diſciples, truly, really, and ſubſtantially his Body and Blood under the appearance of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Had we not ſuch clear proofs from Antiquity, yet certainly the Conſent of the much major and ſuperior part of Chriſtians for this laſt 600 Years, would be ſufficient to any reaſonable mind, who would but conſider, that if it had not been taught by Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe perſons who introduced it and thoſe who followed them would have been guilty of Idolatry (as the Teſt and ſome Proteſtants now accuſe us to be) and by conſequence the whole Church which taught and practiſed it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, would have erred in Fundamentals, and taught a damnable Doctrin, deſtructive of Salvation, contrary to the Promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her:</hi> But when we find, that the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and thoſe others in <hi>Berengarius's</hi> time, were ſo far from pretending that they introduced a new Doctrin, excogitated by themſelves, or invented by ſome of their learned Predeceſſors, that they freely and fully declared, that it had been delivered to them as a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that their predeceſſors in their ſeveral reſpective Countries had taught them the ſame and practiſed it, that all their Hiſtorians and antient Writers had confirmed it; when we conſider alſo how impoſſible it is, that, if the figurative preſence had been once the eſtabliſhed Doctrin of the Church, the Doctrin of the real preſence could have gained ſuch credit, that all Chriſtians in all Countries ſhould conſent to it, and commit manifeſt Idolatry wilfully, againſt their former belief, no one of the Many Learned, Pious, and Couragious Biſhops, who were vigilant in oppoſing the ſmalleſt growing Errors, ever ſpeaking of this as an erroneous Doctrin, or as a novelty; I ſay, when we conſider all theſe things which have been ſo fully and ſo often proved, that nothing but Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can deny them; how can we have the leaſt Difficulty in believing this Doctrin to be, that of Jeſus Chriſt, or his words not to be literally true? Thus much for our Grounds, I come now to ſhew the weakneſs of my Opponents Arguments againſt them, and our Doctrin.</p>

Now as a Poſſeſſor of an eſtate time out of mind, is not condemned, if he proceed upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that the Deed of gift by which his Anceſtors firſt poſſeſſed that eſtate, was good; In like manner muſt it be with us: We believe that Jeſus Chriſt pronouncing thoſe words <hi>This is my Body,</hi>

But as on the other hand, an Aggreſſor, is not to be heard, if he only ſuppoſe the Deed of gift to be void, and argue from thence that the Poſſeſſion is unlawful: So ought it alſo to be with them who oppoſe us. If they only ſuppoſe our Bleſſed Savior did not change the Bread into his Body by thoſe words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> and argue merely upon that ſuppoſition, they ought not to be heard.

                        <p>If the Relative <hi>This</hi> in that Propoſition <hi>This is my Body,</hi> belong to the <hi>Bread,</hi> ſo that the meaning is, <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi>

                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:104173:63"/>does belong to the <hi>Bread;</hi> foraſmuch as Chriſt <hi>took Bread,</hi> and bleſſed <hi>Bread,</hi> and gave <hi>Bread</hi> to his Diſciples, and therefore ſaid of <hi>Bread, This is my Body:</hi> Therefore</p>
                        <p>That Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> muſt be underſtood <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,</hi> or tis plainly abſurd and Impoſſible.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>The Major or firſt Propoſition, he tels us, is our common Conceſſion.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to which I ſay,<note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> If he underſtand the Major in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> ſenſe, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> do, whom he cites for it, that is, that the word <hi>This</hi> in that Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſhould ſo ſignify <hi>Bread</hi> that the meaning of it is, <hi>This truly wheaten Bread, remaining ſuch, is alſo truly the Body of Chriſt;</hi> I grant it; for as I told him before, from the Cardinal, it implies a contradiction: for it cannot poſſibly be, that one thing ſhould not be changed, and yet ſhould be another; becauſe it would be that thing, and not that thing.</p>
                     <p>But if he mean by his Major, that the word <hi>This</hi> in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> has ſuch a reference to Bread that the meaning is <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> that is, this ſubſtance of Bread which I take in my hands, I do by theſe words change into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my Body, I deny it, neither is it our common Conceſſion: for in that ſenſe it is neither an abſurdity nor impoſſibility to underſtand the Propoſition literally.</p>
                     <p>So that you ſee <hi>Luther</hi> will have no change, and will yet have the words to be underſtood literally; and we call that an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.</p>
                     <p>Catholics admit of a change, and ſo underſtand them literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is far from being either impoſſible or abſurd.</p>
                     <p>We argue that the Propoſition in <hi>Luthers</hi> ſenſe admitting of no change, is falſe, abſurd, and impoſſible, unleſs it be taken figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively: But in our own fenſe, admitting a change, is true and genuine, and need not be taken figuratively.</p>
                     <p>His Minor or ſecond Propoſition, he tels us, is <hi>Bellarmins</hi> own grant, nay what he contends for. Is this Learned Cardinal then ſo great a Blockhead as to maintain that the words ought to be taken literally, and yet at the ſame time to contend that the word <hi>This</hi> muſt refer to Bread, andthat if it ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t is plainly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and impoſſible? No no, the Cardinal underſtood better
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104173:64"/>things than to make ſuch blunderings and contradictions; And if our Defender had read him a little farther, he would have found that what he contended for, was, that the words of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not <hi>Speculative</hi> but <hi>Practical,</hi> or, as the Fathers call them, <hi>operative,</hi> performing what they ſignify; and that the word <hi>This</hi> does neither demonſtrate <hi>Bread</hi> nor the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that <hi>being,</hi> that <hi>thing,</hi> that <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> which is contained under the <hi>ſpecies:</hi> ſo that the ſenſe is, <hi>This ſubſtance, under theſe ſpecies, is my Body;</hi> or as <hi>Guitmundus</hi> long ſince explicated it, <hi>This</hi> [till this preſent, Bread] <hi>is</hi> [now] <hi>my Body.</hi> Not as if it remained Bread, and the Body of Chriſt too; but that by the force of thoſe operating words, that ſubſtance of Bread was changed into the ſubſtance of his Body.</p>
                     <p>So that you ſee by this, his ſecond Propoſition muſt be alſo diſtinguiſhed, as having two ſenſes; in one of which it is true, and in the other, falſe.</p>
                     <p>The Relative <hi>This,</hi> in this Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to Bread: I diſtinguiſh the Minor, if you mean, that it ſo refers to it, that that which was Bread is now no more Bread but the Body of Chriſt, the ſubſtance being changed, I grant it; and this Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> contends for: But if you mean that the word <hi>This</hi> ſo belongs to <hi>Bread,</hi> that this Propoſition is true, <hi>This truly wheaten Bread, remaining Bread, is alſo truly the Body of Chriſt,</hi> I deny your Propoſition; for, as the ſame Cardinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, it is a contradiction that one thing ſhould remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed and yet ſhould be another.</p>
                     <p>In proving the Minor you were to ſhew that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for this laſt ſenſe, and that we all conſented to it, if you would have had a Logical concluſion. But that you know is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Tenets; However ſuch a piece of Sophiſtry as this is enough to blind a great many well meaning, tho' illiterate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But the fallacy of it once detected, I hope they will ſee clearer: and this may be done by changing the Medium, For your Argument is no more than this following, and concludes no better.</p>
                     <p>If the Relative <hi>This</hi> in this Propoſition, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> refer to common and unconſecrated Bread, ſo that the ſenſe of the Propoſition ſhould be, this common and unconſecrated Bread is my Body, we muſt needs ſay that Chriſt gave common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſecrated
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104173:64"/>Bread to his Diſciples, or elſe the Propoſition is plainly abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>But the word <hi>This</hi> in this Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> does belong to <hi>common Bread;</hi> for Chriſt took common and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Bread, and of it ſaid, this is my Body.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he gave common and unconſecrated Bread to his Diſciples, or elſe the Propoſition is plainly abſurd and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                     <p>Who does not perceive that this Argument is like another which the Defender has been often told to be unconcluding, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What I bought in the Market, that I eat;</p>
                     <p>But I bought raw Fleſh in the Market:</p>
                     <p>Therefore I eat raw Fleſh. For the change that is made is ſuppreſſed in all theſe Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms, or ſuppoſed not to be, which is the main point which we defend.</p>
                     <p>But to ſhew the unconcluſiveneſs of ſuch Sophiſms as theſe, give me leave to propoſe a parallel caſe, which may in ſome meaſure clear the difficulties.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>h.</hi> being a Subtil Sophiſter, produces this Argument in open Court.</p>
                     <p>If the Relative <hi>This</hi> in this Propoſition, <hi>This is your eſtate,</hi> do refer to the eſtate of <hi>A,</hi> ſo that the ſenſe of it is, this eſtate of <hi>A,</hi> is your eſtate, then by your own conſent, it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood figuratively, or tis plainly abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>But the Relative <hi>This</hi> in that Propoſition <hi>This is your eſtate,</hi> does belong to the eſtate of <hi>A;</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>A,</hi> ſpoke of his own eſtate, pointed to his own eſtate, gave his own eſtate, and therefore ſaid of his own eſtate, <hi>This is your eſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore that Propoſition <hi>This is your eſtate</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood figuratively, or elſe it is plainly abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Would our Defender, if he had been judge in this caſe, have given the eſtate to <hi>h.</hi> for his witty Sophiſm? Or if he had been in <hi>X's</hi> caſe would he have quitted his Poſſeſſion, forced by the irreſiſtibleneſs of a quibble? Who does not ſee the unconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of this Argument in ſuch temporal concerns as theſe; and muſt the world needs be deceived with them where Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is at ſtake?</p>
                     <p>But <hi>h.</hi> will not acquieſce, and notwithſtanding that all Courts Inferior and Superior have condemned him, yet will he ſtill put in his claim, and never ceaſe calumniating both <hi>X</hi> and the Courts of Judicature that gave Sentence againſt him; ſtill inventing

                     <p>This is truly our caſe: I leave the Defender to make the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and the Reader to judge whether obſtinacy in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be not a greater crime than in Law; and whether a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court of Eccleſiaſtical Judicature has not more reaſon to pronounce an Anathema againſt thoſe who diſturb the ſetled peace of the Church, by oppoſing her received Doctrins; than a High Court of Juſtice to condemn a litigious perſon as a common Barreter? Thus much to his firſt Argument.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems I committed a fault before,<note place="margin">§. 76. Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, From the practice of the Jews.

Doctrin Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. pag. <hi>50.</hi>
                        </note> Let us now therefore ſee it,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>As in the Jewiſh Paſſover (ſays he) the Maſter of the houſe took Bread and Brake it and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>This is the Bread of Affliction which our Fathers eat in Egypt;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. <hi>49.</hi>
                           </note> ſo in the Holy Sacrament, our Saviour, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, took Bread and Brake it, and gave it to them, ſaying, This is my Body, which is broken for you; do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.</p>
                        <p>But, as it is evident, that that Bread which the Jews every year took and Brake, and ſaid, <hi>This is the Bread of Affliction,</hi> &amp;c. was not that very Bread which their Anceſtors ſo many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104173:66"/>before had eaten there; but was deſign'd only to be the Type or Figure of it: So neither could our Saviours Diſciples, to whom he ſpake, and who, as Jews, had ſo long been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that Phraſe, ever believe, that the Bread which he held in his hands, which he Brake, and gave them ſaying, <hi>This is my Body, which is broken for you,</hi> &amp;c. was the very actual real Body of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Therefore they underſtood it to be a Type or Figure of that Body which was about to be broken for them.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>In anſwer to this, I ſay Firſt, If not only the Bread but the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb it ſelf, was a Type and Figure of this Sacrament and Sacrifice after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedec;</hi> this being Inſtituted, as our Author confeſſes, <hi>for the like end which the Paſſover had been, and now for ever to ſucceed in its place,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Expeſ. pag. <hi>49.</hi>
                        </note> certainly the thing Figured ought to be more perfect than the Figure, the Subſtance than the Shadow. But if the Perfection of the Subſtance conſiſted only in ſignifying our Bleſſed Saviours ſufferings; certainly that Bread of affliction was as Perfect a Type as this; and the Paſchal Lamb a much more Perfect Figure of his Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, All the whole Argument, you ſee, runs upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that our Bleſſed Lord ſpoke figuratively, becauſe the Maſter of the Feaſt in the Paſſover did ſo; which is as unconcluſive an Argument, as if in my laſt Example <hi>h.</hi> ſhould argue thus, the Predeceſſors of <hi>A.</hi> when they ſhewed the Map of their Eſtate, were wont to ſay <hi>This is my Eſtate;</hi> therefore when <hi>A.</hi> ſaid to <hi>B,</hi> this is your eſtate, he gave him only the Map, and not the Eſtate it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Expeſ. pag. <hi>50.</hi>
                        </note> I cannot but admire that our Defender ſhould think the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> obliged to make leſs exceptions againſt this Argument, becauſe it was the Original remark of the very Jews themſelves long before the Reformation. You will not ſend us ſure to the Jews to know whether our Bleſſed Saviour was the true Meſſias or no; and will you ſend us to them to know whether he gave his Body and Blood to his Diſciples in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? They Crucified the Lord of life as a Malefactor, and muſt they be believed in the higheſt Myſteries of our Religion? No wonder if they who eſteemed him to be mere Man, ſhould eſteem his Bleſſed Sacrament to be more Bread.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, You tell us the Maſter of the Feaſt took Bread and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104173:66"/>Brake it, and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>This is the Bread of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which your Fathers eat in Egypt:</hi> From whence have you this? for I find it not in Scripture. Tis true we find <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.3. that God commanded the Jews to <hi>eat for ſeven days the Bread of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without leaven, to the end they might remember that it was with fear and trembling that they went out of Egypt;</hi> But was it not true Bread they there eat; and why ſhall we not then believe it is the true Body of Chriſt, tho' we eat it in remembrance of his bitter Paſſion?</p>
                     <p>I need not take notice of his other inſignificant Arguments drawn from Scripture,<note place="margin">§. 77. Third Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. From its being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bread af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as that the Apoſtle cals the Sacrament <hi>Bread</hi> even after Conſecration; that <hi>to break Bread,</hi> was the uſual Phraſe in the Time of the Apoſtles for receiving the Holy Communion. Every common Catholick can tell him that <hi>Eve</hi> was called <hi>Bone of Adams Bone; Moyſes</hi> his <hi>Rod,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Expoſ. Doct. Ch.

He has alſo been often told that the Scripture uſually ſpeaks according to the appearance of things, and therefore as it called the Angels, Men, becauſe they appeared like Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo does it call the Euchariſt Bread, becauſe it has the outward Appearance of Bread. Moreover by Bread in the Jewiſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was uſually underſtood any kind of meat, and therefore no wonder if they called this moſt ſolid, and ſuper ſubſtantial Food, Bread.</p>
                     <p>I come now to examin his other Arguments; and firſt,<note place="margin">§. 78. Objections from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Schoolmen. Firſt, from St <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius.</hi>

                     <p>The Words literally rendred are theſe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For as before Bread be Sanctified, we all [it] Bread, but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt having Sanctified it, it is freed indeed from the Appellation,</hi> [or name] <hi>of Bread, but eſteemed worthy of the Appellation</hi> [or name] <hi>of our Lords Body, altho' the nature of Bread hath remained in it, and it is not called two Bodys but one Body of the Son: So alſo here the Divine Nature having overflowed the Body, both theſe have made up one Son, one Perſon. But however we muſt acknowledge an unconfuſed and inai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible manner, not in one Nature only, but in two perfect</hi> [Natures.]</p>

                     <p>If St. <hi>Chryſoſiom</hi> brought this Parallel in oppoſition to the Hereſy of <hi>Appollinarius,</hi> and meant, as our Defender would have it, that as <hi>Ceſarius</hi> believed the Subſtance of Bread remained after conſecration together with the Subſtance of Chriſts Body uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the Euchariſt: ſo ought he alſo to believe that both the Divine and Human nature did remain unconfuſed, in one Chriſt: It muſt neceſſarily follow that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> believed the Body of Chriſt was as really in the Euchariſt, as he believed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to be Really in Chriſt: And if ſo, it would as neceſſarily follow, that as Chriſt is to be adored becauſe he is God, tho' he be man alſo; ſo is the Euchariſt to be adored becauſe the Body of Chriſt is there, tho' Bread ought not to be adored: It would alſo neceſſarily follow that Chriſts Body would be in as many places at once as there were Hoſts; That his Body and Bread would be both in one place; That his Body would be in Heaven and upon our Altars at the ſame time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that whilſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> deny Tranſubſtantiation, he makes him eſpouſe all the difficulties of it and Conſubſtantiation mixed together.</p>
                     <p>For if this Parallel be exact (as our Defender would have it) St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> muſt have held this opinion concerning the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; That, as there are two different Natures in Chriſt, the Human and Divine, which being Hypoſtatically united together, make up but one Perſon, Chriſt; So are there two Natures in the Euchariſt, Bread and the Body of Chriſt, both which make up but one Subſtance, the Body of Chriſt; and that as in Chriſt the Divinity Hypoſtatically united to the Humanity makes but one Subſiſtence, one Perſon in two different Natures, and that truly called Divine; So in the Euchariſt the Nature of Chriſt, united to the Nature of Bread, makes up but one Body, and that worthy to be called the Body of Chriſt. And that, as the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature of Chriſt, by being united to the Divine, has many
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104173:68"/>Epithets given it, which properly belong to the Divinity; ſo the Bread it ſelf, by the Union of the Body of Chriſt with it, is worthy to receive the Epithets (I may add alſo the Adoration) due to the Body of Chriſt. If this be the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let our Defender ſpeak; if not, let him confeſs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> did not agree with them, or that he has a wrong conception of his Parallel.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>3ly.</hi> Suppoſing this Epiſtle genuin, and that part of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted,<note place="margin">§. 81.</note> let us ſee whether it make for them or us; and to do this we muſt conſider the ſcope and drift of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Parallel, and gather the Senſe of the Epiſtle as well as we can from ſuch a barbarous Tranſlation and uncorrect Copy.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>All the difficulty lies in the word <hi>Nature,</hi> which our Defender thinks ought to be taken in the ſame ſenſe, as where it is applied to the Human and Divine Nature.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not queſtion whether this be not one of the leſs faithful Tranſlations in this Epiſtle, becauſe, we know not what the word may be in Greek, neither will I go about to ſhew that the Accidents themſelves are often ſaid to have their nature, and That ſometimes called the Nature of the Subſtance of which they are the Accidents. But I muſt ſay that if the word <hi>Nature</hi> in that Place meant <hi>Subſtance,</hi> or <hi>Body;</hi> ſo that the ſenſe ſhould be this; <hi>tho' the Subſtance or Body of Bread remain,</hi> the Parallel would have been falſe, and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> inſtead of diſſwading <hi>Caeſarius</hi> from the Hereſy of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> would have drawn him to that of <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> For <hi>Caeſarius</hi> muſt neceſſarily have Argued thus: Your Parallel is betwixt the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Subſiſtence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> If then there be two <hi>Subſtances</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there are alſo two <hi>Subſiſtences</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But this was far from St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> deſign.</p>
                     <p>His intention was therefore to ſhew <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> that, as in the Bleſſed Sacrament after Conſecration there is but <hi>one Subſtance. one Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> tho' the Accidents of Bread remain, and that this Subſtance is truly called the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo in the Myſtery of the Incarnation there is but <hi>one Son, one Perſon,</hi> and that Divine, tho' the Nature of the Manhood do remain.</p>
                     <p>Now what can be more clear for Tranſubſtantiation than this, that in the Euchariſt there ſhould be but <hi>one Body, one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and that the <hi>Body of Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But our Defender objects, that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> only ſays <hi>it is worthy to be called the Body of Chriſt,</hi> and it is <hi>called not two Bodyes, but one Body of the Son:</hi> and therefore, the change is only in the <hi>Appellation,</hi> and not in the thing it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>But certainly, if <hi>Caeſarius</hi> had underſtood St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in that ſenſe, <hi>Caeſarius</hi> might have anſwered him, You would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me I ſee to be an <hi>Arian,</hi> and believe there is only a change in Chriſt as to Appellation, and that he is not truly God, but only called ſo.

                     </p>
                     <p>I agree then, with our Defender, that <hi>our Diſpute is not only about the Real Preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood, and abſence of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine;</hi> (tho' formerly there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute

                     </p>
                     <p>They who Read this and the foregoing diſtinction entirely, will ſee clearly that he was very far from aſſerting that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin which affirms the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which the Church calls Tranſubſtantiation, was not believed in his time; and that he only affirmed he was not able to define the manner how that converſion was made.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 87. <hi>Scotus.</hi> Defence <hi>pag.</hi> 64.</note> our Defender ſays, <hi>Scotus is yet more free, and declares <hi>their</hi> Interpretation contrary to Tranſubſtantiation to be more eaſie and to all appearance more true, inſomuch that he confeſſes that the Churches Authority was the principal thing that moved him to receive our Doctrin.</hi>

                     <p>I do not wonder that <hi>Scotus</hi> ſhould ſay, he was chiefly moved

And the force of the rejection conſiſts in this, that the words of our Lord have been underſtood by the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and therefore they muſt be verified properly:</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> after him, looked upon the Churches having always underſtood the words of our Saviour literally, to be the ſtrougeſt Argument againſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentarians, who Erred in underſtanding them Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: But what is that to our Defenders Propoſition? And where does the Cardinal ſay, <hi>there is as much reaſon for the one as the other, abſtracting from the Churches declaration,</hi> which is the ſenſe of his Propoſition? Wherefore now it comes to my turn to <hi>remit him</hi> (as he does me) <hi>to the Readers Cenſure, and his own Conſcience for correction.</hi>

                        <hi>Since it is certain that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles appointed or practiſed, nor the Church for above a</hi> 1000 <hi>Years required or taught any Adoration of this Holy Sacrament; neither could they according, to Monſieur de</hi> Meaux's <hi>Principles</hi> [who holds, that the Preſence of Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt ought to carry all ſuch as Believe it, without all ſcruple, to the Adoraton of it] <hi>have believed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104173:74"/>the Corporeal preſence of our Bleſſed Saviour in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Antecedent he goes about to prove firſt from the Scriptures ſilence in this matter;<note place="margin">ſsect; 91. I.</note> which tho' it ſays, <hi>Take, Eat, Do this in remembrance of me, yet never ſays, This is my Body, fall down and worſhip it:</hi> And from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he reproved the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for violating this Holy Sacrament, did not tell them (tho' it was obvious, and much to his purpoſe)</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>that in profaning this Holy Sacrament they were not only guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which it was Inſtituted to repreſent to us; but even directly Affronted their Bleſſed Maſter Corporeally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there; and whom inſtead of Profaning, they ought, as they had been taught, to Adore in it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">II.</note> From the new practices of Elevating the Hoſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſays he in the <hi>7th Century,</hi> to repreſent the lifting up of Chriſt upon the Croſs, but not to expoſe it to the People to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it; from the Bell, the Feaſt of the Bleſſed Sacrament, the Pomp of carrying it through the ſtreets, Expoſition of it upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Addreſſes to it in caſes of Neceſſity, and performing the chief Acts of Religion in its preſence: all which, he pretends, are but Inventions of yeſterday, or were never mentioned in Antiquity.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">III.</note> Becauſe the Primitive Chriſtians inſtead of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did (as he ſays) many things utterly inconſiſtent with it; as Burning in ſome Churches what remained of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; permitting the People to carry it home that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; ſending it abroad by Sea and Land without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that we can find had to its Worſhip; burying it with their Dead; making Plaiſters of the Bread; mixing the Wine with their Ink; which certainly, ſays he, are no inſtances of Adoration.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Before I begin to Anſwer this Objection,<note place="margin">§. 92.</note> I muſt beg leave to ſhew our Belief in this matter, and the Grounds we go upon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt we believe,<note place="margin">It is lawful to Adore God and Chriſt wherever they are.</note> whoever acknowledges Jeſus Chriſt to be God and Man, may lawfully Adore him wherever he has a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ground to believe him to be preſent; yet is he not at all times obliged to pay this actual Adoration; becauſe otherwiſe the Apoſtles muſt have done nothing elſe but Adore when ever they were in the preſence of their Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Grounds of our Belief that our Bleſſed Saviour is really Preſent in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, are undoubtedly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104173:74"/>Rational, as I think I have ſufficiently ſhewn; and therefore all thoſe who believe him Preſent, may lawfully Adore him there,<note place="margin">We cannot always pay this actual adoration.</note> tho' they are not always Obliged actually to pay that Adoration; otherwiſe they muſt do nothing in preſence of the Sacrament but Adore Him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is worthy our Remark that the words <hi>Sacrament, Hoſt</hi> or <hi>Euchariſt</hi> are ſometimes taken for Chriſt alone, ſometimes for the Species alone,<note place="margin">VVe adore Chriſt in the Sacrament; not what is ſenſible.</note> and ſometimes for both Chriſt and the Species; but when we ſpeak properly of Adoring the Sacrament, we ſpeak only of Adoring Chriſt in the Sacrament: For we do not adore what is Viſible, Tangible, or any ways Senſible in the Sacrament; but only Chriſt Jeſus, whom we believe to be under thoſe Viſible, Tangible, and Senſible Elements.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Church being confirmed in this Belief, has Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as occaſion ſerves, to command the payment of this Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is Due at all times; and to ſet apart ſome ſolemn Feſtivals, or Ceremonial Rites to invite her Children to perform this Duty.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Conſiderations being premiſed; I deny his Antecedent:<note place="margin">§. 93.</note> and to his Proofs I anſwer.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt I ſay, the Scriptures ſilence is no more an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us in this,<note place="margin">I. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſilence no Argument againſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> than it is againſt the Adoration of our Lord when preſent in the fleſh: for tho' we find there a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of going to Chriſt, and following him; yet will he ſcarce find an expreſs place in the Goſpels, where Chriſt commands his Diſciples to Adore him. This Adoration depending wholly on his being God, it was ſufficient that he convinced them of his Divinity; and we being thus convinced by his own words that he is preſent in the Sacrament, we are obliged to adore him there.</p>
                     <p>And if St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not Argue as our Defender would have had him, yet does he do it with no leſs force and Energy. It was ſufficient to tell them it was the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> that to receive it was an <hi>Annunciation of his Death;</hi> that they who received it <hi>unworthily were guilty of the Body and Blood of their Lord;</hi> that they <hi>cat and drunk their own Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not Diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi> That <hi>therefore there were many ſick and weak amongſt them, and many died;</hi> Theſe, as they were ſufficient Arguments to perſwade them not to profane the Sacrament; ſo were they ſufficient Arguments to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104173:75"/>convince them and us of the Obligation to Adore him Preſent in it, tho' St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not put them in mind of that Neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

                     <p>I will conclude, with this one Reflection, which I deſire all thinking perſons to conſider: If the Doctrin of the real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Preſence of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament carried with it ſo many Abſurdities as our Modern Authors would make us believe; and the Adoration of Chriſt in the Sacrament was ſo manifeſt an Idolatry, as they pretend; all Chriſtians certainly, who were tender of their Salvation, muſt needs have had an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of, and ſo much the greater averſion from that practice, by how much it was more contrary to their great Principle, that <hi>God only was to be Adored.</hi> Seeing then it is manifeſt by the conceſſion of Proteſtants and public Records of every Nation, that the Adoration of the Sacrament was publicly practiſed, not in one corner of the World only, but throughout all Chriſtendom for this laſt 800 Years; and that no perſons, that we know of, ever contradicted that practice, but ſuch as were immediately condemned as Heretics: Seeing alſo the plain expreſſions of the Primitive Fathers, ſhew this to have been alſo practiſed in their days; and that no beginning of this practice can be ſhewn; we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that our Modern Authors are deceived, both as to the Abſurdities with which they charge the Doctrin,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104173:77"/>and the Idolatry of the Practice: and that the Church in all thoſe Ages did believe, as we do, that Chriſts Body and Blood was truly, really, and ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament, and there to be adored.</p>

                  <p>The word Sacrifice has various acceptations. Some times it is taken Improperly or Metaphorically, for any act of Devotion referred to the Honor and Worſhip of God, as Prayer, Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, Praiſe, Contrition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when we ſpeak properly, we intimate an External act of Religion, whereunto the office or function of a Prieſt is ordained. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.1. And according to this acceptation we define a Sacrifice to be, An External act of Religion, whereby a Prieſt lawfully called, offereth unto God alone ſome Senſible and Permanent thing, with alteration or real change thereof, in due acknowledgment of Gods ſovereign Dominion over us, and our all-dependance on his power and providence.</p>
                  <p>Our Defender in this, and the following Articles (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Expoſition) ſeems to lay the ſtreſs of the cauſe upon the Council of <hi>Trents</hi> calling this <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> whereas he thinks it is only <hi>Metaphorically</hi> ſo: And will have nothing to be called <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in which there is not <hi>a true and real deſtruction, or ſlaying of the thing Sacrificed;</hi> and cites <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the Margent for it. In anſwer to which I need only give that very objection of the Cardinal at length, in which any one will ſee that our difference here is more in the Name than in the Thing, tho' however this muſt be repreſented as one of <hi>thoſe Errors which moſt offend the Church of</hi> England, and our bleeding diviſions muſt be kept open to the ruin of both Church and State.</p>

                     <hi>In the Sacrifice of the Maſs either there is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>a true and real mactation and ſlaying of Jeſus Chriſt, or there is not. If there be not, then</hi> (according to you) <hi>the Maſs is no real Sacrifice: for when the Eſſence of a Sacrifice conſiſts in being ſlain</hi> (as it is your opinion) <hi>a true and real Sacrifice requires a true and real ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if there be, then we might truly ſay, that Chriſt is truly and really ſlain by Chriſtian Prieſts; but this is rather a Sacrilege than a Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this manner of Arguing any one may ſee that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinals,<note place="margin">§. 100.

And had he gone a little farther in this Author, he would have ſeen how all the Eſſential parts of a Sacrifice are contained in it.</p>
                  <p>Our Defender in his Expoſition tells us, there are Four things required to make a Sacrifice.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 66. Four things reqired to a Sacrifice.</note> 1. <hi>That what is offered be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Viſible.</hi> 2. <hi>That of profane which it was before, it be now made Sacred.</hi> 3. <hi>That it be offered to God. And</hi> 4<hi>ly, by that offering ſuffer an Eſſential deſtruction.</hi> And ſuppoſes the greateſt part of theſe conditions, nay all of them, to be evidently wanting. Now <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in this ſame place tells him, that three of theſe Conditions are fund in the Conſecration of the Euchariſt, and the other is evidently included in them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt (ſays he) <hi>a Profane or common thing Bread, is by Conſecration made the Body of Chriſt,</hi> the Viſible Species of Bread remaining; neither does it follow from thence, that Bread is only Sacrificed,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104173:78"/>but that which remains, the change being made.</p>

                     <hi>By Conſecration that which is offered is ordained to a True Real and external change and deſtruction, which was neceſſary for the Eſſence of a Sacrifice: for by Conſecration the Body of Chriſt receives the form of food; but food is ordained to be Eaten, and by that to a change and deſtructon: neither is that any objecton, that the Body of Chriſt ſuffers not, nor loſes its natural being when we receive the Euchariſt: for it loſes its Sacramental being, and thereby ceaſes to be really upon the Altar, ceaſes to be a ſenſible food.</hi> The Cardinal being thus Vindicated, I ſay,</p>

                     <hi>Deacons had not power to offer, but only Prieſts,</hi> and the like Expreſſions. Upon what ground then can he pretend that all theſe Expreſſions were Metaphorical, and endeavour to elude all theſe, by ſticking firm to his Notion of a Sacrifice that <hi>there can be no true offering without ſuffering;</hi> And becauſe, Chriſt does not ſuffer in the Maſs, therefore he is not truly Offered? The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> one would have thought has fully removed <q>that difficulty, telling him, that if we take the word <hi>Offer</hi> in the ſenſe it is made uſe of in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Actual death of the Victim, we will publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is now no more Offered up, neither in the Euchariſt, nor any where elſe. But becauſe this word has a larger ſignification in other places of Scripture, where it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid, we offer up to God what we preſent before him, the Church, which forms her Language and her Doctrin not from the ſole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> but from the whole body of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104173:79"/>the Holy Scriptures, is not afraid to ſay that Jeſus Chriſt Offers up himſelf to God wherever he appears before his Face upon our behalf, and that by conſequence, he Offers up himſelf in the Euchariſt, according to the Holy Fathers expreſſions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We affirm then that in the Maſs is Offered up to God a True proper and Propitiatory Sacrifice. A Sacrifice in remembrance of that on the Croſs, and applying to us the benefits there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us. A Sacrifice in which Jeſus Chriſt is both the Prieſt and the Victim.

                  <p>I might alſo take notice how cautiouſly the Defender avoids my queſtion concerning <hi>what the Church of</hi> England <hi>holds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her Prieſts, whether they be truly Prieſts or no; whether ſhe acknowledge a Sacrifice and an Altar, truly and properly ſpeaking or no; tho' poſſibly not in ſuch a rigorous ſenſe as may be put upon the words.</hi> To all which he returns a profound ſilence.</p>
                  <p>As for the Reflections upon what has been ſaid, I leave the Reader to make them himſelf; and hope, if he have a True Zeal for the Salvation of his Soul, he will ſeriouſly conſider the premiſes, and heartily beſeech Almighty God to enlighten his mind to the knowledge of his True <hi>Faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi>

                     <hi>ART. XXII.</hi> Communion under both Species.</head>
                  <p>THe Vindicator tells me,<note place="margin">§ 102. The Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhewn to be neither faiſe, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, nor frivolous.</note> that I advance Three Arguments in this Article <hi>from the public Acts of their own Church. The firſt falſe. The ſecond both falſe and unreaſonable. And the third no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</hi> By which I ſee he is not unskilled in Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and very willing to caſt the Lyer upon me, if he could: But the <hi>falſe,</hi> the <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> and the <hi>impertinent</hi> will be found perhaps to lye at the Accuſers Door.</p>
                  <p>My Argument was but one, and I think neither unreaſonable nor impertinent. He had told me from their <hi>30th</hi> Article,<note place="margin">Art. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>declared, that the Cup ought not to be denyed to the Lay-people; for as much as both parts of the Lords Supper by <hi>Chriſts Ordinance and Commandment ought</hi> to be adminiſired <hi>to all</hi> Chriſtian men <hi>alike.</hi>
                     </hi> From hence I Argued, that if the Church of <hi>England</hi> allowed the Communion to be given under one Species in caſes of Neceſſity, ſhe was not conſonant to her ſelf, nor agreed with her <hi>30th</hi> Article, which looked upon it as the expreſs Command of Jeſus Chriſt to give it under both Species; and his expreſs Commands are certainly indiſpenſible. Alſo that if ſhe did allow it lawful to give it under one kind in caſes of neceſſity, the Arguments which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> had brought againſt the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> were equally in force againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> viz. that they muſt not deny, but that both Species were not by the Inſtitution of Chriſt Eſſential to the Communion; ſeeing no neceſſity could require us to go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Eſſential Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But that the Church of <hi>England</hi> did allow her people to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate under one Species, in caſe of Neceſſity, I proved from <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths Proclamation, before the Order of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In which I ſaid, he had ordained, <q>That the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſhould from thenceforth be <hi>commonly</hi> delivered and Adminiſtred unto all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons within this our Realm of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other our Dominions under both kinds, that is to ſay, of Bread and Wine.</q> 
                     <hi>except neceſſity otherwiſe require.</hi> This, he ſays, as thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, is <hi>Falſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> in that Proclamation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104173:80"/>does not ordain any ſuch thing, but only ſays, that foraſmuch as in his High Court of Parliament lately holden at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> this was Ordained—Therefore, He for the greater Decency and Uniformity of this Sacred Euchariſt now thought fit to appoint the following Form and Order for the Adminiſtration of it. Let it be ſo, if you pleaſe, that <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> did not by vertue of this Proclamation ordain it; yet the inſerting of that Act of Parliament into that Proclamation ſerved as a Rubrick to inform all thoſe who were to Adminiſter that Sacrament, that if neceſſity required it, they might give it in one kind. And my Argument has gathered ſtrength by being oppoſed, ſeeing it has now not only a Proclamation, but an Act of Parliament to back it.</p>
                  <p>But he ſays, it is alſo <hi>
                        <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to Argue as to the preſent State of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>from what was allowed only, and that in caſe of neceſſity too in the very beginning of the Reformation.</hi> If the Church of <hi>England</hi> had Repealed this Act of Parliament, or by ſome Authentic Act or Canon declared it to be void, it might have ſeemed unreaſonable in me to produce it. But if this Act be ſtill in force, I ſee no reaſon why we may not juſtly conclude, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> holds it lawful in caſes of neceſſity to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate only under one Species; which if ſhe do, all her Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Catholics (as if they deprived the people of an Eſſential part of the Sacrament, violated Chriſts Ordinance, gave but a half Communion, and the like) have as much force againſt her ſelf, as us. And if ſhe leave it to her Miniſters to judge when neceſſity requires it to be given only under one kind, why will ſhe deprive the Catholic Church repreſentative of that Power? And if a natural Reaſon, ſuch as is a loathing of Wine, may induce private Paſtors not to give the Cup, to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons; why may not a Supernatural Reaſon, ſuch as is the detection, and by that means, the refutation of an Hereſy, not to mention the avoiding of many indignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> induce ſuch a Church repreſentative to command that which was already pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by moſt Chriſtians, eſpecially knowing that ſhe deprived them of nothing which was Eſſential to a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>As for the Note, I made uſe of it only as a thing fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, and not as an Argument againſt communicating under both kinds. However I might juſtly conclude, that if under one Particle the whole Body of Jeſus Chriſt be contained; and this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104173:80"/>Body be now a living Body, (which it cannot be, unleſs the Fleſh and Blood, the Soul and Divinity be united) They who receive one Particle, receive whole Chriſt, and with him his Gifts and Graces, that is, a full Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>So that the firſt Falſity he accuſes me of is (as you ſee) a plain miſtake: I do not ſay he had no Reaſon for it; becauſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had indeed placed the Citation in the Margent, over againſt a wrong place; but had he conſidered the ſenſe, he might have ſaved that ungenteele Anſwer. The ſecond Argument, as he calls it, is neither falſe in the bottom, nor unreaſonable. And if the laſt be not ſo convincing an Argument, yet does it not want ſome force. And I will add to this Note another, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Defender to take notice of, that that Act of Parliament, tho' it ordained Communion under both kinds, unleſs in caſes of neceſſity, yet was ſo moderate as not to <hi>condemn thereby the uſage of any Church out of the Kings Majeſties Dominions.</hi> Which moderation had he been endowed with, he would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch deteſtation of the Doctrin, nor paſſed ſo ſevere a Sentence againſt the Catholic Church for the Practice.</p>

And in order to this we may reflect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">I. All Error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faith is of a later date then Faith.</note> That an Error in Faith is Twofold, either affirmative or negative. A negative is a denyal of a Truth, which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and propagated over the whole World; An affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is an Affirmation of a falſehood for a revealed Truth, when it had not been ſo revealed nor propagated; from whence it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, That all Error againſt Faith is of a later date than Faith it ſelf, and being ſuch can never, tho' it pretend to it, ſhew an uninterrupted Tradition from thoſe to whom revealed Truths had been firſt committed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">II.</note> Truth is ſo amiable in it ſelf, that if Error did not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to cloath it ſelf in its Dreſs, no perſons would embrace it, but it is impoſſible for Error ſo to counterfeit Truth but that there muſt be ſome Eſſential difference,<note place="margin">Error cannot imitate Truth in all things.</note> ſome characteriſtical note, by which the one may be fully diſtinguiſhed from the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe Errors being as I ſaid either the forſaking of a known Truth delivered to that Age by the foregoing, or an introducing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104173:82"/>of a Novelty which had not been Delivered. It manifeſtly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that amongſt all the pretences which Error can make for it ſelf it can never at its firſt riſe challenge to have been delivered by the immediate foregoing Age,<note place="margin">Error at its firſt riſe can never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Tradition.</note> but muſt take a leap to ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten time, and pretend the immediate foregoing age to have been deceived, and either through negligence to have forgotten what had been taught to their Predeceſſors, or for want of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance to have ſuffered Errors to creep into her by degrees, till they ſpread over the face of the whole World.</p>
                  <p>The letter of Scripture ſuffering various Interpretations,<note place="margin">IV. An uniter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is the diſtinguiſhing note betwixt Truth and Error.</note> it is plain that Error may pretend to Scripture; the antient Fathers being likewiſe dead, and not able to vindicate themſelves, their writings may be wreſted, and Error may make uſe of them to back it ſelf; Reaſon too being byaſſed by Intereſt, Education, Paſſion, Society, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be led away, and form ſpecious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for what is falſe. Fancy alſo may be led aſtray, and as experience tells us, may pretend new lights, which, like the <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> leads men into error; Tradition only reſts ſecure, and Error can never plead for that without pretending ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. Thus tho' the <hi>Arians</hi> Pretended Scripture, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers of the firſt Age, Reaſon, and it may be a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied Light within them, yet could they not pretend to an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Tradition, becauſe that Age in which they firſt begun to teach, withſtood them, and they themſelves accuſed that and the foregoing Age of Error.</p>
                  <p>It is then the diſtinguiſhing note of Error,<note place="margin">V. Error always accuſes the Church in the preceding age.</note> to cry out againſt Tradition or the Unwritten word, and her plea is always as I ſaid either the Foregetfulneſs of the preceding Ages, or their want of Vigilance; and thereupon ſhe dares never ſtand to the Judgment of that preſent Age in which ſhe Begins to appear, but appeals (forſooth) to the purer times next the Apoſtles, to the fountain head, to the written Word, to ſome dark expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Fathers of the firſt Ages, or the like,<note place="margin">VI. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church, the Nature of the Doctrins of Chriſt, and her Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies condemn this Plea.</note> as thinking her ſelf ſecure, becauſe ſhe can give ſome plauſible reaſons for her Tenets.</p>
                  <p>But if we examin her plea we ſhall find it groundleſs: For if we conſider the conſtitution of the Church of Chriſt, and the nature of the Doctrine which ſhe teaches, we muſt neceſſarily Conclude that it is impoſſible for her either to be ſo
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104173:83"/>Negligent, as to forget the Eſſential Truths delivered to her; or ſo Careleſs, as to ſuffer deſtructive Errors to ſpread themſelves inſenſibly.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtitution of the Church is ſuch,<note place="margin">VII.</note> that there are Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Paſtors and Teachers ſet over the whole flock by Almighty God, who are obliged to watch over their people, let they ſhould be led away into Error, and have had the promiſe of the ſame Omnipotent God, that he will be with them to the end of the World, teaching them All Truth, and by conſequence ſecuring them from Deſtructive Errors, So. that tho' it were poſſible by the courſe of Natural cauſes that all the Paſtors and Teachers in the World, ſhould in ſome one Age or other forget to teach a delivered Truth; or be ſo negligent as to ſuffer an Error to creep in by degrees, and ſpread it ſelf from Country to Country, or from Age to Age, till ſome more vigilant perſons ſhould ariſe to reeſtabliſh Truth or detect falſehood; Yet if we conſider the promiſes of Almighty God, and the Vigilance he has over his Church, we may ſecurely rely upon him, that he will never ſuffer his Church to be thus prevailed againſt, nor ſuch an Univerſal Negligence or Lethargy to predominate in her.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, even her Speculative Doctrins are ſo mixed with Practical Ceremonies, which repreſent them to the Vulgar, and inſtruct even the meaneſt capacities, in the obſtruſeſt Doctrins, that it ſeems even impoſſible for any to make an alteration in her Doctrin without abrogating her Ceremonies, or changing her conſtant practices. And it muſt needs appear to any conſidering man, even abſtracting from the aforeſaid promiſes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that it is impoſſible that any Age ſhould forget to practiſe what the preceding Age had taught them; or caſt off univerſally her received Ceremonies, and neither Paſtors nor people ſpeak againſt ſuch Innovations.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered I think I had juſt reaſon to ſay, that the preſent Church in every Age was to be judge of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality or not univerſality of Tradition; and that if ſhe declared her ſelf, either by the moſt general Council that Age, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, could afford; or by the Conſtant Practice and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form voice of her Paſtors and People, every private Church or perſon ought to ſubmit to her deciſions.</p>

                     </label> But Good Sir, weigh a little the force of your Argument, and ſee whether it be not built upon a mere ſuppoſition, that the Church has erred or may err in the delivery of her Doctrins; even againſt the plain words of Scripture, or poſitive Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Fathers. But ſuch an abſurdity being ſuppoſed, what wonder if many others follow after.</p>
                  <p>Again, tell me, are thoſe Records you ſpeak of plain to any one that is able to ſearch into them? If ſo, I hope the Church is as clear ſighted and able to ſearch into them, as any individual Church or perſon; Or are they obſcure? And then I ſuppoſe you will allow the univerſal Church's conſtant practice in that Age, or her declarations in her Councils to be at leaſt a better Interpreter, than ſuch Private perſons or Aſſemblies; And if the Catholic Church examining thoſe paſſages in the antient Fathers tells me they are ſo far from contradicting her Practices or Doctrins, that if rightly underſtood they ſpeak the ſame thing with her, I think there lyes a greater obligation on me to ſubmit my Judgment to that of the Univerſal Church, than obſtianately to follow my own ſenſe, or that of a particular Church diſſenting from the whole. And that this is the caſe betwixt Catholics and Proteſtants the Defender knows, and the Reader may gather from this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But the Defender has yet a more cogent reaſon againſt this method,<note place="margin">§. 107.2. <hi>Objection.</hi>
                        </note> which is that it is apt to ſet up Tradition in competition with the Scriptures, and give this Unwritten word the upper hand of the Written.</q>

                     </label> Had he ſaid, that this method would be apt to ſet up the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councils, and the judgment of the Church before the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirit or judgment of Particulars, I ſhould readily have granted what he ſaid.<note place="margin">Tradition and Scripture are not Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> But I ſee no competition in our caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Scripture and Tradition, but that they both ſtrengthen each others Teſtimony, unleſs he will have the Text and the moſt authentic Comment to be competitors.</p>
                  <p>Now the Defender <hi>looks upon it as a high affront to Scripture,</hi> that the Church's decrees or practices <hi>ſhould obtain and be in force with all its members, when many of them may be perſwaded that they cannot find what ſhe decrees in, nay, that it is contrary to the word of God.</hi> And declares for himſelf and all his Party, <q>That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow that any <hi>particular Church or Perſon,</hi> ſhould be obliged upon thoſe grounds to receive that as a matter of Faith or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which upon a diligent and impartial ſearch <hi>appears to them</hi> not to be contained in, nay, to be contrary to the <hi>Written word of God.</hi> For in this caſe he thinks it reaſonable, that the <hi>Church's ſentence ſhould be made void,</hi> and the voice of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Traditions ſilenced, by that more powerful one of <hi>the lively Oracles of God.</hi>

                  <p>The Conceſſions which our Defender had made in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, were indeed ſuch as might very well have given us hopes he would have ſubmitted to the natural conſequence of them:

                  <p>This poſition is ſo Extravagant that I think I need only give it in his own words,<note place="margin">§. 109.</note> to make him and all that party who he tells us have approved his Book,<note place="margin">HIs Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons examined.</note> either aſhamed of this Doctrin and recal it, or elſe declare they admit to Authority in the Church: and this I ſhall do as I examin his Exceptions in their order.<note place="margin">Firſt Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is only a particular Church An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.

                  <p>But our Defender found this reaſon too ſolid to be eluded by his querks, and therefore ſaid nothing to it; but juſtifies his exception by an Argument which I wonder any man of reaſon would offer to produce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now if this</hi> [that we take all Chriſtian Churches in Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deſence <hi>pag.</hi> 78.</note> for the Roman Catholic Church] <hi>in truth,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be that which they mean, when they ſtile the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the Catholic Church, then ſurely every other National Church, which is of that Communion has as good a title to the name of Catholic, as that of</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſenſe I pray is there in this Propoſition thus worded? If he mean (as he muſt to make an Argument) that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular National Church in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> has as good a title to the Name of the Catholic Church, as all thoſe particular National Churches joyned together have; he will have much a do to perſwade any Rational man to believe him, who can but underſtand that a part is not the whole</p>
                  <p>But if he mean that every particular National Church in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> has as good a title to the name of Catholic, as the particular Dioceſe or National Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; (that is, as he explicates himſelf preſently after, has <hi>the ſame Purity and Orthodoxneſs of Faith.</hi>) Suppoſe we grant him it (always allowing that difference betwixt the See of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, as there is betwixt the head and the other members of the ſame Body) what conſequence will he draw from thence againſt us, who allow all other Churches in Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be truly members of the Catholic Church, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Supreme Paſtor? Oh, ſays, he <hi>This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders every diſtinct Church profeſſing this Faith equally Catholic with the reſt, and reduces the Church of Rome, as well as others within its own Suburbican Dioceſe, and ſo makes it only a particular, not The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> And what then, I pray? Who ever ſaid that the particular Dioceſe of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Univerſal Church? We ſay
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104173:85"/>indeed that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Supreme Paſtor of the whole Church of Chriſt, which we therefore call the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church; but this does not make the Suburbican Dioceſe to be this Catholic Church; For, as the <hi>Empire</hi> when it was in former times diffuſd through moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> part of <hi>Aſia</hi> and part of <hi>Africa,</hi> was called the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> from the Imperial City <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo is the Catholic Church ſpread over the face of the whole world called the <hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi> becauſe every particular Member is joyned in Communion with the one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Paſtor whoſe See is at <hi>Rome.</hi> And this Univerſal Church we ſay can neither fall into Error, nor prevaricate the Faith in any neceſſary Points of it, whatſoever a particular Church may do.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears that his ſecond and third Exceptions are nothing to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">§. 110. <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>3d</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions null.</note> as being grounded upon his notion of the Roman Catholic Church, taken for the particular Dioceſs of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>yet all this would not make her the Whole or Catholic Church; unleſs it could be proved that there was no other Chriſtian Church in the world, beſides thoſe in Communion with her; and that all Chriſtian Churches have in all ages profeſſed juſt the ſame Faith,</hi>

                  <p>How Extravagant ſuch a Doctrin as this is, I leave to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader to conſider; And return to the Defenders Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>He tells us,<note place="margin">§. 111.</note> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot paſs for Catholic, unleſs we can prove; either firſt, <hi>there was no other Chriſtian Church in the world be ſides thoſe in Communion with her;</hi> or ſecondly, <hi>that all other Chriſtian Churches have in all ages profeſſed juſt the Same Faith, and continued juſt the Same Worſhip as ſhe hath done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wiſh he had explicated himſelf a little clearer, and not kept himſelf in ſuch Univerſals as is that of <hi>a Chriſtian Church:</hi> For by a Chriſtian Church may be underſtood any Aſſembly of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,<note place="margin">By the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church we mean All Orthodox Chriſtian Churches united.</note> tho' profeſſing known and condemned Hereſies; as wel as an Orthodox Church, maintaing the Purity of Faith and Worſhip. If therefore to prove a Church to be truly Catholic, he think us obliged to prove there was never any other Aſſembly, but thoſe in Communion with that Church that ever profeſſed the name of Chriſt, or were called Chriſtians, or that ever held a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Faith or way of Worſhip from what ſhe held; he muſt either expect we ſhould ſay there never was any Hereſy amongſt thoſe who profeſſed to believe in Chriſt; nor any Error in their Worſhip, but that all Chriſtian Churches held together in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to Savlation; which is manifeſtly falſe; or elſe that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy and Schiſm do not hinder perſons from being Members of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104173:86"/>Catholic, Church; But this we cannot do, unleſs we will open a Gate, for all even lawfully condemned Hereſies to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Catholic Church (for I ſuppoſe he will not deny but ſome have been juſtly cut off by Her) And tell the world plainly, that the <hi>Arians</hi> or any other Hereſy, may as well claim a title to the Catholic Church as any other body of Chriſtians, tho' Orthodox in their belief. And if this be his meaning, it follows, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Church whatever can be lawfully cut off from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, ſo long as they turn not Apoſtats, and deny their Chriſtianity. All which is abſurd in an eminent degree.</p>
                  <p>But if he mean only this, that to prove a Church to be truly Catholic, we muſt ſhew there never was any Orthodox Church in the world but what was a Member of that Church; and that all Orthodox Churches in all Ages profeſſed juſt the ſame Faith, and continued juſt the Same Eſſential Worſhip that ſhe did: we will joyn Iſſue with him, and doubt not but to be able to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any unbyaſſed judgment, that the Roman Catholic Church can Alone challenge this Prerogative;<note place="margin">All Orthodox Churches in the World communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </note> and we dare affirm there never was any Orthodox Chriſtian Church in the world but what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> And that all other Churches in the world, that were Orthodox, profeſſed juſt the ſame Faith (as to all the Eſſential Points of it) and practiſed the very ſame Eſſential Worſhip which ſhew now does.</p>
                  <p>That this later acceptation of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> is what ought to be embraced, will appear to any man who conſiders, that when we ſpeak of the Catholic Church, we ſpeak of that Church, which has all the other marks of the True Church of Chriſt, joyned with that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality;</hi> viz. <hi>

                  <p>To prove therefore this Truth,<note place="margin">§. 112. That Church alone which is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church proved.</note> that that Church alone which is in Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is this true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, I muſt deſire my Reader to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when Jeſus Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he told them, that they who did not believe, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but they who did believe and were baptiſed, ſhould be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That theſe Believers were called Chriſtians, that is, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church or Kingdom of Chriſt; which Church or Kingdom was to be ſpread over the face of the whole world, to continue till the end of the ſame, to preſerve the Doctrins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to her, to be <hi>one</hi> and therefore free from Schiſms, <hi>Holy</hi> and therefore ſecured from Hereſy and damnable Doctrins; All which we expreſs in our Creed; <hi>I believe one Holy Catholic and Apoſtolic Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the Scripture tells us there muſt be Hereſies and Diviſions, which as they are deſtructive of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> the marks of his true Church; ſo are they alſo impediments to Salvation, and therefore muſt be avoided; and ſeeing this Church muſt be free from them, ſhe muſt have a power given her from Chriſt to ſeparate thoſe who are Heretics or Schiſmatics, from the Orthodox Chriſtians, and cut them off from being Members of her Communion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this Orthodox Church having once lawfully cut off ſuch or ſuch Heretical or Schiſmatical perſons or Aſſemblies, they could not pretend to be Members of her Communion ſo long as they maintained thoſe Errors, or refuſed to pay a due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and therefore if, during their Separation, other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or Schiſms ſhould bud out, the Orthodox Church was not obliged to call in the aſſiſtance of thoſe formerly condemned Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to help her to cut off or condemn the ſecond; nor thoſe firſt and ſecond Aſſemblies to help her to condemn a third, a fourth, or a fifth. But, as ſhe Alone had Authority to cut off the firſt Heretics or Schiſmatics, ſo had ſhe alſo Alone the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to cut off the ſecond and third, and in a word, all other ſucceeding Aſſemblies, who either thus oppoſed the Truths, delivered to her, or refuſed to pay her a due obedience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe things thus conſidered, it neceſſarily follows, that in after Ages that Church alone can challenge the Title of being truly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104173:87"/>One Holy Catholic and Apoſtolic (which in one word we call Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic or the true Orthodox Church of Chriſt) which has from Age to Age cut off Ariſing Errors,<note place="margin">That Church alone can be called truly the Catholic Church, which has in all ages condemned ariſing Errors and was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned her ſelf.</note> condemned proud Schiſmatics, and Excommunicated obſtinate Heretics and Heretical and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Aſſemblies, and was not her ſelf condemned or cut off by any ſentence of the One Holy Catholic and Apoſtolic Church: And tho' perhaps the number of thoſe particular Heretical or Schiſmatical Aſſemblies (one condemned in one Age and another in another, ſome few of all which might perhaps ſurvive even till our time) might be conſiderable if taken altogether, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in themſelves; yet being every one of them lawfully cut off by that Orthodox Church, they can never ſtand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with her, nor challenge a place in her Councils; neither is ſhe obliged to call in their help to Condemn any other New Hereſy ariſing after them: And if that New Hereſy ſhould pretend ſhe was obliged, ſuch pretentions would be unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This, I told him, was a Doctrin, that if admitted,<note place="margin">Maintains all Diſſenters.</note> would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all Diſſenters, that are or can be from a Church and eſtabliſh as many Religions as there are perſons in the world,<note place="margin">Deſence <hi>pag.</hi> 80.</note>

                  <p>But let us ſee how he maintains it does not directly follow from what he has laid down in his Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> he tells us, that <hi>he allows of this Diſſent or Oppoſition</hi> (from the whole Church) <hi>only in Neceſſary Articles of Faith, where he ſuppoſes it to be every mans concern and Duty, both to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to make as ſound and ſincere a judgment as he is able. And ſecondly, He tells us, that as he takes the Holy Scriptures for the Rule, according to which this Judgment is to the made; ſo be ſuppoſes theſe Scriptures to be ſo clearly written, as to what concerns thoſe neceſſary Articles, that it can hardly happen that any one man, any ſerious and impartial enquirer, ſhould he found oppoſite to the whole Church in his Opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe two wild Suppoſitions, without any proof of them, as if they were firſt Principles which needed none, he draws this Admirable Concluſion, worth the conſideration of every Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and for which the Diſſenters will no doubt return him thanks.</p>
                  <p>If (ſays he) in <hi>Matters of Faith a man be to judge for himſelf; and the Scriptures be a clear and ſufficient rule for him to judge by; it will plainly follow, that if a man be evidently convinced, upon the beſt enquiry he can make, that his particular Belief,</hi> [in neceſſary point of Faith] <hi>is founded upon the Word of God, and that of the</hi> [univerſal] <hi>Church is not, he is obliged to ſupport and adhere to his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104173:89"/>own belief in oppoſition to that of the Church</hi>— becauſe <hi>he muſt follow the Superior, not the Inferior guide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from hence any Rational Man will certainly conclude, that at leaſt all Diſſenters in neceſſary points of Faith (of which I ſee not but that they themſelves muſt be judges) may make uſe of this Principle to maintain their Diſſent; And as long as they ground themſelves upon the Scriptures interpreted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have but confidence enough to think they have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them ſufficiently; what ever Church pretends to puniſh or compel them, does an unjuſt action; becauſe they are obliged to follow the Superior not the inferior guide. Neither is <hi>this method</hi> (as the Defender acknowledges it is) <hi>liable only to ſome Abuſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. <hi>81.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>through the Ignorance or Malice of ſome men:</hi> But the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church (and much more every particular) is put into an incapacity of reducing either the Ignorant or the Malitious to their duty, if they have but Pride enough to be poſitive <hi>in,</hi> as well as conceited <hi>of</hi> their own Opinions.</p>
                  <p>But however <hi>this Method, tho' thus liable to ſome abuſes, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the main moſt juſt and reaſonable, and agreeable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which does not take upon her to be Miſtreſs of the Faith of her Members,</hi>

                  <p>Let us now examin a little his two <hi>Poſtulata's</hi> upon which he grounds this Doctrin.<note place="margin">§. 116.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>His firſt is, That <hi>he allows of this diſſent or oppoſition</hi> (from the whole Church) <hi>only in Neceſſary Articles of Faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders firſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulatum, anſwered.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I thought the Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had at leaſt, held the whole Church to be unerrable in Fundamentals,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104173:90"/>or neceſſary Articles of Faith: Our Defender knows very well that the moſt eminent of his Church have held ſo, and if he have forgot it, I will at another time refreſh his memory. If he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it was only their private opinion, but not the Doctrin of their Church; I deſire him to ſhew his aſſertion, that <hi>the whole Church may err in neceſſary Articles of Faith, and every private perſon is bound to diſſent from her,</hi> &amp;c. to be the Doctrin of their Church. Their <hi>19th</hi> Article ſays indeed, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches have erred; But affirms, <hi>the Viſible Church of Chriſt to be a Congregation of faithful men, in which the <hi>pure Word of God</hi> is Preached; and the Sacraments be duly miniſired <hi>according to Chriſts Ordinance,</hi> in all thoſe things that of <hi>neceſſity</hi> are requiſite to the ſaine.</hi> Now one would think that that <hi>Congregation of Faithful</hi> who Preach the <hi>
                        <hi>pure Word</hi> of God, an adminiſter the Sacraments duly <hi>according to Chriſts Ordinance</hi> in all thoſe things that of <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> are requiſte to the ſame;</hi> ſhould be freed from error in thoſe Neceſſaries. But this is the new Proteſtancy, our Defender endevors to expound; and it is a hard caſe that we muſt beforced to teach thoſe who pretend to expound the Doctrin of their Churcy, what it ſhe holds. Let him therefore I ſay ſhew this to be the Doctrin of his Church before he build other Doctrins upon it.</p>
                  <p>And when he has done that, there will remain ſome other Obſtacles to be removed, before his Suppoſal will be admitted by us. One of which is how he proves it obligatory for every individual perſon to diſſent from the Church or oppoſe her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins, in thoſe neceſſary Articles of Faith, upon their being evidently convinced in their judgments that they have hit upon the right ſenſe of Scripture and the Church has not; and yet will not allow them the ſame Liberty, upon the ſame Evidence, in matters which are not ſo neceſſary. One would think that if they be obliged to ſubmit to the Church in non-neceſſaries; they ſhould be ſo much the more in neceſſaries. Unleſs he will have the Church to be an unerring guide in non-neceſſaries, and mans particularl judgment of the ſenſe of Scripture Errable; and on the contrary mans particular judgment of the ſenſe of Scripture infallible in Neceſſaries, and the Church's judgment fallible.</p>
                  <p>No, But his reaſon is becauſe <hi>it is every mans concern and duty hoth to Judge for himſelf, and to make as ſound and ſincere a Judgment
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104173:90"/>as he is able</hi> when the Diſpute is about <hi>neceſſaries;</hi> whereas he is not ſo bliged about non-neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>I deny not but that it is every mans concern and duty to make the beſt Judgment he can about neceſſaries to his Salvation; when a leſs care is required in non-neceſſaries. But is it not the Church's concern and intereſt to do the ſame? and when ſhe has done that, will right reaſon teach every particular man to prefer his ſenſe before hers in either of them? No certainly, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will dictate to him that the beſt and ſecureſt means he can take not to be deceived in his Judgment is to rely upon the Churches ſentence; becauſe God has given a Promiſe to ſecure his Church from Error; whereas there is no Promiſe to Individuals that they ſhall not be Deceived, in ſearching the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If the Defender, can ſhew ſuch a Promiſe he will inſtead of deſtroying the Popes Infalliblity, ſet up as many infallible Popes as perſons. For to be Infallible in this caſe is no more than ſeriouſly and impartially to follow an Infallible rule, which is ſo clear in it ſelf, that every ſerious and Impartial Enquirer ſhall certainly underſtand the right ſenſe of it. Every individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore (according to our Defenders ſuppoſition) who is fully convinced that he has made uſe of the beſt endeavors he can (his Employments, Capacity, Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſidered) to come to the right ſenſe of Scripture, which Scripture is in it ſelf Infallible, may aſſure himſelf that he has Infallibly hit upon the true ſenſe of Scripture; from whence it would neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (truth being but one) that we ſhould have no Errors in the world but amongſt thoſe who are neither ſerious nor impartial in their enquiry: For the fault muſt either, <hi>firſt,</hi> be in that they do not uſe their beſt endevors; or ſecondly, that their Rule they go by is faulty; or thirdly, that they take that for a Rule which is not rruly ſo, and guiding themſelves by a Rule which was not given them to be their Guide to wonder if they go aſtray.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Defender would gladly be nibling at Doctor <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> principle,<note place="margin">Princip. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>the Scripture contains the whole Will of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104173:91"/>God ſo plainly revealed, that no ſober enquirer can miſs of what is neceſſary for ſalvation.</hi> But ſeeing how unable the Doctor was to defend it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Error non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt.</note> he gives ſome limits to it, as afraid to ſpeak out what he would willingly have believed: And therefore does not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſay, That the Scripture is ſo clear and ſufficient a Rule in neceſſaries, that every ſober Enquirer cannot miſs of the right ſenſe of it; but that it is <hi>ſo clear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that it can <hi>hardly</hi> happen that any one Man, any ſerious and impartial Enquirer, <hi>ſhould be found oppoſite to the whole Church, in his opinion.</hi>
                     </hi> Now what he ſays can <hi>hardly</hi> happen, may at leaſt happen ſometimes; and if it do, what muſt that one Man do? <hi>He is then obliged</hi> (ſays the Defender) <hi>to adhere to his own Belief, in oppoſition to that of the Church.</hi> How! is Scripture the Rule of Faith? Is this Rule. clear and ſufficient in Neceſſaries to every ſober Enquirer; and is it not clear to the whole Church? Or does the whole Catholic Church of Chriſt ceaſe to enquire ſeriouſly and impartially? Yes, if this Man be but <hi>evidently convinced</hi> that he is the ſober Enquirer, and ſhe is not, he muſt prefer his own ſenſe before hers, (ſays the Defender.) But what is this Evident Conviction here required? If all Mankind, for Example, tell me this is the Year 1687 ſince Chriſt, and I ſhould ſtand ſtifly againſt their Account, and tell them, it is but the Year 1686; certainly I ſhould be eſteemed mad by all Mankind, and my pretending my being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently convinced in my own imagination, or my really being ſo, would not hinder me from being juſtly condemned of the greateſt Folly and Impudence imaginable, as preferring my own ſenſe and ſentiments, before the common ſenſe and ſentiments of the whole World: But this it ſeems which would be eſteemed Folly in ſuch temporal concerns, would be Prudence with our Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the neceſſary concerns of Faith and eternal Happineſs; for with him <hi>tho' it be highly uſeful to individual perſons or Churches,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I would gladly know of our Defender what he means by <hi>Neceſſary Articles,</hi> all which are ſo clear in Scripture: Are they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104173:91"/>all thoſe which are contained in the three Creeds? Or will he run to <hi>Hobs</hi> his neceſſaries, only a belief in Chriſt? If he take in all the Creeds (as certainly he is bound by his Church) or if at leaſt he admit that of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in which he declares, that except a Man believe all that is contained in it, he cannot be ſaved; let him tell me, and prove it when he can, that all the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it are ſo clear in Scripture, that every individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, every ſober Enquirer ſhall certainly find them there. The Socinians will ſmile at his Boldneſs. But certainly according to his Principles it muſt be ſo; for if thoſe abſtruſer Doctrins of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity, Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> contained in that <hi>Creed,</hi> be <hi>neceſſary Articles</hi> of our <hi>Faith;</hi> and all Neceſſaries be clear in Scripture to every <hi>ſober Enquirer</hi> (which they muſt be, if every Man muſt judge for himſelf, and Scripture be the only Rule to judge by) then it would neceſſarily follow, that every Tinker, Cobler, Weaver, or Tankerd-bearer, if they do but ſeriouſly enquire into Scripture, would certainly find them there. But if neither they, nor our Defender, nor his whole Church can find ſuch evidence for them there, as to ſilence the Socinians, who profeſs to follow the ſame Rule, to be ſincere, and to uſe all due diligence, it will cortainly follow, that thoſe Points are not clearly contained in Scripture, unleſs we take the Authority of the Church along with us for the interpretation; and by conſequence, not neceſſary Points of Faith, with our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</p>
                  <p>If any one therefore enquire into the occaſion of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, even in neceſſaries amongſt thoſe who follow the ſame Rule, and uſe their beſt endevors, they will find their Error to proceed from this, that they err in making choice of that for their Rule, which is not ſo. And to ſhew that Proteſtants, err in this; making Scripture, as interpreted by their own private Judgments, the only Rule of Faith, I make uſe of this Argument, beſides the ſeveral reaſons before alledged,<note place="margin">§. 119. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4.

                  <p>All Chriſtians agree with the Apoſtle, that <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> and that this Faith is but <hi>one.</hi> They all agree alſo that this Faith contains in it many Myſteries beyond the reach of mere human Reaſon; ſo that man, by the uſe of that alone, could not come to the knowledge of the chief Myſteries
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104173:92"/>of our Faith: The Trinity, Incarnation, Original Sin, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They all affirm therefore that God who ſent his Son to redeem man, (who could not do any thing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſatisfy his infinite Juſtice) would not command him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this one Faith under the pain of Eternal damnation, and at the ſame time leave him without a means to bring him to the knowledge of what he was to Believe, This means is called the Rule of Faith, by Controvertiſts.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing God would have all men to be ſaved, of what learning or capacity, of what age, country or condition ſoever; this Rule or this means muſt be general and applicable to all, and therefore Plain and Eaſy, by which the Ignorant and unlearned may arrive at the ſame one Faith as well as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8.</note> for God has <hi>prepared a Way that the wayfaring men tho' fools ſhall not Err therein:</hi> It muſt be Viſible and Apparent to All perſons in All places, and in All Ages; to All I ſay who will not ſhut their eyes: It muſt be Sure, Certain, and Infallible, that the ignorant who Rely upon it may come to the unity of Faith with Security, and the Learned who follow it, may be convinced of the truth of that one Faith rationally, and oppugners find no ſubſtantial Arguments againſt it. All which qualifications do not only ariſe from the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of Almighty God, but are conformable to the very notion of a Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>If then the Scripture as interpreted by that private judgment of Particulars be this Rule of Faith, it muſt have all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages towards the uniting us in this Faith without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>I will not deſcend to particulars, and ſhew how the Scripture is void of the eſſential qualifications of a Rule; that has been done by many hands, and particularly by the queſtion of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: But I will Argue from what our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves grant us.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe then it will not be denyed me but that the Scripture, even in neceſſaries,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</note> may be differently interpreted, ſince St. <hi>Peter</hi> affirms that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable</hi> do not only <hi>Wreſt</hi> the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>other Scriptures alſo to their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> now the queſtion is only, (when things are thus contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) which is the True ſenſe of Scripture; and ſince theſe Controverſies may ariſe in neceſſary matters of Faith, God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104173:92"/>would not leave us deſtitute of a means to come to know which is the True and genuine ſenſe of this Scripture in thoſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and this means muſt be, as I ſaid before, <hi>eaſy, plain general, ſecure</hi> and <hi>infallible;</hi> or elſe this Scripture, (ſuppoſing, not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the Rule of our Faith) would be uſeleſs to ſome part of mankind (if it wanted any one of thoſe qualifications) and by conſequence thoſe perſóns might juſtly complain that God had not taken a ſufficient care for their Salvations.</p>
                  <p>If we examin our Defenders Rule for us to come to the True meaning of this Scripture, he tells us it is a <hi>ſerious and impartial inquiry:</hi> If ſo, then it would neceſſarily follow that every ſerious and impartial Enquirer, would infallibly hit upon the true Faith, which Faith being but <hi>one,</hi> all thoſe impartial Enquirers would be at <hi>unity</hi> in their Belief. But ſince experience tells us that many ſerious and impartial Enquirers (if we can believe any men in what they affirm, with the moſt ſolemn proteſtations imaginable, in a matter of ſuch high concern) do differ in the ſenſe which they draw from Scripture even in neceſſaries, we muſt conclude, That Scripture interpreted by this private reaſon of every individual perſon, cannot poſſibly be this <hi>eaſy, clear, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and Infallible rule,</hi> or means to come to an <hi>unity in Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I ſaid againſt this Private Reaſon of particular perſons or Churches,<note place="margin">§. 120.</note> concludes alſo againſt the Private Spirit which ſome pretend to, which Spirit if it were the Spirit of God, would certainly teach all perſons the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>Others there are who tell you that the means to come to the knowledge, of the true ſenſe of Scripture is to compare one Text with another, to examin the Commentators, the Original Languages, the Antient Writers, and Interpreters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this way; beſide that it is coincident with Private Reaſon which we have already ſhewn cannot be our Infallible Rule to come to the true ſenſe of Scripture, is moreover impoſſible to be done by the generality of Mankind, whoſe concerns to get a livelyhood are ſuch, that they have neither time, opportunities, nor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to do it.</p>
                  <p>Our Defender will perhaps Argue here from his good friends Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chilling worth,</hi> that they need not take ſuch pains; nay moreover, that if they uſe only ſuch a moderate induſtry as is conſiſtent with their employments, tho' they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104173:93"/>ſhould err, God will not impute it to them.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to which, I would only ask them, Whether God has eſtabliſhed a Faith or no, which muſt be <hi>one,</hi> and without which <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe him:</hi> If they cannot deny this as being the plain words of Scripture; I ask again what is oppoſite to Faith but Error in its eſſentials? where therefore has God promiſed in Scripture that a man who errs in the eſſentials of his Faith ſhall not have that Error imputed to him, when on the contrary. he tells us that <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he ſay theſe people are in an invincible ignorance, and God will not puniſh that; I muſt anſwer him, that God has not left the generality of mankind without an eaſy, general, and Infallible means to overcome that ignorance, if they will but make uſe of it.</p>

                  <p>Before I anſwer, I muſt needs ſay that I think this Queſtion, tho' it be the ground-work of our Defenders foregoing Poſition, and without the ſuppoſal of which he can never pretend it to be reaſonable, yet will perhaps be derided by him when propoſed in ſuch plain terms; For no man certainly can ever think that the whole Church of Chriſt, againſt which the Gates of Hell are never to prevail, can fall into ſuch a Total Defection as to Apoſtatize and oppoſe ſuch places of Scripture as are plain to every underſtanding.

                  <p>The Defender knows very well, that the differences betwixt us and them lyes rather on the contrary ſide, and that if the Scripture be plain for either ſide it is for<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </label> My anſwer is therefore, that the Defender, and they who with him ſuppoſe the Church can ordain things directly oppoſite in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, either to Faith or Manners, even in things clear to every underſtanding, do not conſider the notion of a Church, nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that God has given to ſecure it from ſuch Damnable Errors, as muſt deſtroy its Eſſonce: So that eſtabliſhing a Falſe notion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proving it for their ground, no wonder if many Abſurdities ariſe from it. From which it will appear, that a Libertines argument for his Debauches, drawn from a ſuppoſition that there is no God, no Heaven, no Hell, nor other Life, is as concluſive as theirs, who ſuppoſe the whole Church can or ever ſhall propoſe a truth to be believed, or an action to be practiſed, which is contrary to the expreſs words of Scripture in places plain to every underſtanding: or contradict Divinely delivered Truths.</p>
                  <p>However the Defender tells us, that they allow a deference, and that <hi>whatſoever deference they allow to a National Church or Council,</hi>

                     <hi>the ſame they think in a much greater degree due to a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

                  <p>Upon this account I deſired him to conſider whether the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> had not the qualifications of a General and free Council, and whether the Four firſt General Councils were not liable to the ſame exceptions as were made againſt the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he calls a new queſtion hookt in; and gives an old thread-bare anſwer to it, as if we never had before confuted it.</p>

                  <p>But what, is there no Authority given to the Church to call her Paſtors together, in caſes of neceſſity, but that it muſt be the Temporal Power muſt do it? If ſo, then our Defender muſt condemn the firſt Council of the Apoſtles (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) and all the other Councils held till <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors time. But if he dare not do this, but anſwer that the Church had the Priviledge at that time whilſt the ſecular Power was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104173:96"/>Heathen; I ask him how ſhe came to loſe it afterwards? Did Princes by ſubmitting themſelves unto the Church rob their Mother of her juſt Authority? Tis true they aſſiſted by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Commands alſo, and ſo ſtrengthned the obligation of Aſſembling themſelves: But will any one ſay that ſuch an accumalative power in aſſiſting the Church was a depriving her of that Authority?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if he cannot deny but the Church had that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when the Secular Powers were heathens and enemies to Chriſtianity; I hope he will not deny her the ſame when ſome part of thoſe Powers are Enemies to the Orthodox Faith; for the Church is liable to the ſame dammages from an Heretical Prince as from an Unbelieving.</p>
                  <p>Again, the whole practice of the Church is againſt what our Defender ſays. It is well known,<note place="margin">

                  <p>How often has our Author been ſhewn that this pretence is nul; And the Council of <hi>Sonſtance,</hi> that of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the whole Catholic Church vindicated from that odious imputation, of believing that <hi>Faith and Plighted promiſes were not to be kept with Hereticks?</hi> Had the Defender peruſed our Moral Divines, as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104173:97"/>well as Controvertiſts, he would have found it to be a Catholic Doctrin, That Faith is as much to be kept to Heretics, Inſidels, Heathens, Enemies, nay even Subjects in Rebellion (Princes having at ſuch times parted with their own Rights) as to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics themſelves in all reſpects; and that no exceptions are made but ſuch as judicious Proteſtants grant ought to be made even betwixt themſelves; as where the Faith given was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute but conditional, and that condition was not performed; or if the matter of the Faith, Oath, or Promiſe, was a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be done, either by ſome Divine or Human Law, if in reſpect of that Human Law, it were a Faith given by inferiors and ſubjects to ſuch Laws?</p>

                     </note> that it is more than Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Huſſe</hi>'s ſafe Conduct from the Emperor was either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, which Conditions were not kept, he flying from the Council without leave; or at moſt, no other than what was granted by that Council afterwards to <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and upon which he alſo thought fit to venture himſelf; that is, that he ſhould have a <hi>ſafe conduct from violence (Juſtitiâ ſemper ſalvâ) but not from Juſtice?</hi> Seeing neither he nor his adherents (who at that time writ the relation of his Death) ever claimed the privilege of ſuch a ſafe Conduct, or accuſed any of the Breach of it?</p>

                     </note> that if any fault was here committed, it was by the Secular Power, and not the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; for the Church proceeds not to the Sentence of Death, but after her having convicted them of Hereſy or Schiſm, turns them over (as ſhe did <hi>Huſſe</hi>) to the Secular Power; ſo that if the Secular Power had given him a ſafe Conduct, not only from violence but from the Execution of Juſtice, that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power was to blame to break it; but the Church was not concerned in it, nor the Council whoſe ſafe Conduct he never did demand?</p>
                  <p>Neither let the Defender here produce the Councils Decree in the 19 <hi>ſeſs.</hi> to prove that that Council held it lawful to <hi>break Faith with Heretics,</hi> and diſpenſed with the Emperor in his Duty; for that Decree was made after the Execution of <hi>Huſſe;</hi> and it only pretends that the Emperor by his ſafe Conduct can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prejudice the authority of another: So that the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

                  <p>How often has it been ſhewn that the Delegates of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who were <hi>Huſſites,</hi> about 16 Years after repaired to the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> upon the fecurity of the Council and the Emperor <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond</hi>'s ſafe Conduct, which they would never have done, had they not been convinced that the terms of <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi>'s ſafe Conducts were too narrow to ſhield them from the execution of Juſtice, tho' it might Secure them from any injury?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, is it not plain that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> gave them a ſafe Conduct, with a <hi>non-obſtante</hi> to the Decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtance?</hi> and yet notwithſtanding all theſe plain Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been produced over and over again, the Defender moves not one jot from the firſt Accuſation, but infinuates it, as if it were a known and approved Truth.</p>

                  <p>If then (theſe points being cleared) we conſider the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which <hi>Arius</hi> and his followers, with the <hi>Socinians</hi> at this day, make againſt the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the other condemned parties againſt the other Three Councils, I think I had juſt reaſon to ask him whether the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was not as General and Free a Council as any of the Four?

                  <p>Neither will I go to the antient Canons of the Church, but ſhall conclude,</p>
                  <p>That ſeeing it is manifeſt that ever ſince the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did exerciſe this Univerſal Paſtoral care over the whole Church, Excommunicating offending Biſhops in other Kingdoms and Countries, reſtoring thoſe, that had been Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unjuſtly, to their Sees, and Confirming others, calling General. Councils and Preſiding in them; and that Appeals were uſually made to him in greater Cauſes from all Countries, no beginning of which can be ſhewn, nor no oppoſition made to it, in thoſe Primitive Ages, but only by the <hi>Arians</hi> or other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Heretics: Seeing, I ſay this is clearly matter of fact, we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that this Authority was looked upon at that time as given him by Divine Right, and as coming down in a conſtant practice from the Apoſtles. For ſeeing all perſons in all Ages and Countries are ready to defend their Privileges and oppoſe uſurpations, had this been ſuch, or had they been exempt from ſuch Juriſdiction, they would have Unanimouſly oppoſed it in ſome of the ſucceeding General Councils, after they had ſeen ſuch Epiſtles from the Popes, challenging that Authority. But we find them ſo far from this, that his plea is admitted in thoſe very Councils, and not the leaſt Oppoſition made.</p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:104173:101"/>
                  <p>From what I have already ſaid, it will appear how eaſy a thing it might be to ſhew him in the Primitive Fathers, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, what is given by all Catholics at preſent to his Holyneſs, or challenged by him as of Neceſſary Faith.</p>

                  <p>The laſt Authority which he ſays the Pope lays claim to, is, that <hi>all other Biſhops muſt derive their Authority from him;</hi> The terms of which Propoſition are very ambiguous, and therefore when our Defender has explicated his meaning more clearly, and ſhewn that all Catholics allow it in the ſenſe he intends, I will undertake to ſhew him, that the ſame Authority was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be due to him, even in the Primitive times; For the Church has not innovated in this, any more than in her other Doctrins.</p>

                     <p>I muſt therefore here, Sir, call upon you once more, and mind you of your Neceſſary Duty, that is, of making a Public acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of thoſe <hi>Calumnies</hi> you have thrown upon the Church, and the <hi>miſrepreſentations, unſincerities</hi> and <hi>Falſifications</hi> you have made uſe of to back thoſe Accuſations.</p>

                     <p>The Truth of what I ſay, has been abundantly ſhewn in the foregoing Articles; and I admire after ſuch accuſations,<note place="margin">Defence <hi>p.</hi> 84, 85.</note> that you can talk ſo confidently of a <hi>peaceable Expoſition, kindly and charitably performed,</hi> and which you were willing <hi>to hope</hi> might be received <hi>with civility.</hi> Is this the way to heal our Breaches, to bring that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> which you ſay you ſo much long for?</p>
                     <p>You tell us indeed that <hi>our Errors are many of them diſavowed by us,</hi> and is not that enough?<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>103.</hi>
                        </note> Why ſo much pains then to prove us guilty of them? Why is there not an union at leaſt in thoſe points? Why muſt we be ſtill called <hi>Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c? We know our ſelves Innocent, and we aſſert it; we know the Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo, and we prove it; but yet the moſt ſolemn aſſertions, and the cleareſt proofs muſt paſs for nothing amongſt thoſe who pretend to Civility, Peace, and Charity.</p>
                     <p>I conjure you therefore, Sir, by all that is Sacred, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name of Chriſtian, by that Unity that ought to be in the Church of Chriſt, as well as by its Sanctity, by the Eternal God and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, that as you tender the Salvation of your own Soul, and thoſe of ſo many others as have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by you to an imitation of thoſe Calumnies, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the falſe witneſs you have born againſt your Neighbors, and hinder not that union which might otherwiſe be hoped for in the Church of Chriſt, by hindring thoſe who have gone
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104173:103"/>aſtray, from returning to the Arms of their Innocent Mother.</p>
                     <p>I know the pride of our nature is apt to hinder perſons from retracting what they have once advanced; but certainly they who conſider that Eternity is at ſtake, and that an injuſtice, which will render us miſerable for that Eternity, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated without making ſatisfaction, will not find it ſo difficult to acknowledge their miſtake, tho' wilful, rather than run into inevitable damnation. And pray God give you this ſerious thought and reſolution.</p>
                     <p>And when you are ſerious, Sir, and reſolved to do your duty, pray conſider alſo; Firſt, the obligation you have brought upon your ſelves by ſuch accuſations: Conſider; Secondly, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you have thrown your ſelves and your adherents into by your ſeparation; and Laſtly, conſider the many advantages you are deprived of by being ſeparated from our Communion.</p>
                     <p>If you accuſe us Catholics of Idolatry and of thoſe other Errors and Crimes you mention,<note place="margin">I. §. 134. The obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has laid upon himſelf by accuſing the Catholic Church of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</note> I ſee not how you can pretend us to be members of the Church of Chriſt, one of whoſe inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable marks is that of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> which is certainly inconſiſtent either with ſuch Crimes or Errors; for as a man cannot be accounted a ſound man if he have a mortal diſtemper on him, ſo neither can a Church be accounted Holy if it teach a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Doctrin: And if we cannot be accounted members, neither can they who preceded us in the ſame Practices and Doctrins; and therefore you who lay this accuſation, oblige your ſelves to ſhew a viſible Church, diſtinct from that of ours, which has in all ages been free from ſuch Errors and damnable Idolatries; but this, as I have formerly taken notice, your Book of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to which you ſubſcribe, thinks impoſſible; and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the conſequences of denying Chriſt to have ſuch an Innocent Church, tells us plainly that for above 800 Years, <hi>All men,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Third part of the Homilie againſt peril of Idolatry, <hi>pag.</hi> 143. <hi>fol. Anno</hi> 1673.</note> 
                        <hi>women and Children of whole Chriſtendom fell into the damnable Sin of Idolatry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Shew us ſuch an Innocent and Holy Church as this, and we will Communicate with her. But if you cannot ſhew ſuch an one, you muſt give us leave to believe our Bleſſed Saviour, who promiſed that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt his Church,</hi> and that he would ſend <hi>the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter who ſhould remain with her to the end of the world,</hi> &amp;c. rather than, with ſuch
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104173:103"/>Calumniators, accuſe him of the breach of his promiſe, and affirm that he had no Holy Church on Earth for above 800, nay as others ſay, for above 1000 Years. And ſeeing we know our ſelves Innocent of thoſe Crimes, of which we are accuſed as well as they, how can we communicate with our and their accuſers?</p>
                     <p>I would not have you Sir, to fly to your uſual Parallel, and tell us that God had always his Wheat among the Tares in the field of his Church. The Parable is juſt, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; that is, there ſhall be always good and bad in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. But if you compare the Wheat to the orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, and the Tares to Errors, or Heretical Tenets, they certainly, who were guilty of thoſe Errors, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Tares; and if, as your Book of Homilies affirms, the whole Chriſtian world was guilty of them, both in Head and Members for above 800 Years, where was the Wheat all that time? The belief of ſome true Doctrins, mixed with many Errors would not ſecure them, unleſs you will ſay, that the ſame individual Root might bear both Wheat and Tares, and be at the ſame time gathered into the Granary and burnt with unquenchable fire. But if you ſay there were at that time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians, and a Church which Preached the word of God, and adminiſtred the Sacraments rightly, and was free from the Tares of falſe Doctrin; let it or its Members be ſhewn, and we will Communicate with them. But it is eaſier to talk this out of a Pulpit, than prove it to men of Senſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">II. §. 135. The danger he is in by being ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her Communion.</note> the danger you are in by being thus Separated from the Church of Chriſt, is ſuch, that any one I think who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it ſeriouſly with its conſequences, cannot but deſire to free himſelf.</p>
                     <p>You deny not but that the Church in Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a true Church, and that Salvation was and is to be had in it, that ſhe had and has true Paſtors, true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, true Creeds, the true Word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Only you ſay, Errors have crept into her ſince the Firſt 400 Years, and that you have reformed them by the Example of thoſe firſt Ages, and by the infallible Word of God.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides that it is a queſtion to which it will be difficult to give a ſatisfactory anſwer, from whence they had it who
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104173:104"/>aſſumed that Authority to reform; and what teſtimony they can give of their miſſion: I would only ask you, Sir, what aſſurance you can give me, that your pretended Reformers in this laſt Age ſee more clearly the ſenſe of this infallible writing, or know more exactly what was the practice of the Firſt 400 Years, than all your Forefathers of thoſe preceding ages? If you cannot give a ſatisfactory anſwer to this, and ſhew ſuch an aſſurance that you have hit upon the right Faith and they did not, ſuch an aſſurance I ſay, upon which we may truſt the Salvation of our Souls (which being a matter of the higheſt concern the ſecurity ought alſo to be the higheſt) we ſhall have reaſon to doubt you have been out in your refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and that whilſt you pretended to reform, you have on the contrary made a breach in the Unity of the Church and have rent the Seamleſs garment of our Lord, and torn his myſtical Body, a Crime not much unlike theirs who Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Buffeted, and Crucified him, and will be as ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, they were evidently convinced that Scripture was againſt the univerſal practice and belief of the Church, and therefore they were obliged to follow <hi>the Superior not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Guide,</hi> I deſire to know how they came to be evidently convinced: and if you cannot ſhew ſome ſecure and unerring principle to rely upon for that conviction, I muſt exhort you to conſider the hazard you have run your ſelf into by following them; the danger which all thoſe who are miſled by you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; and how ſtrict an account you and they muſt one day give, if that Principle of yours, That <hi>every individual perſon may diſſent from the Catholic Church, ſo his judgment be convinced he follows the right ſenſe of Scripture, and ſhe does not,</hi> be found falſe, and you and they deluded by it into diſobedience: For ſeeing our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf bids us look upon them that will not hear the Church, as no other than <hi>Heathens or Publicans,</hi> ſuch diſobedience muſt needs be followed with a puniſhment anſwerable to thoſe crimes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">III. §. 136. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of by being out of the Church.</note> as for the advantages which you are deprived of by being ſeparated from the Catholic Church, I beg of you to conſider them not only in general but in Particular; And to this end, pray read ſeriouſly the concluſion of the Third
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104173:104"/>Diſcourſe of the Guide in Controverſy, and compare the times which preceded your pretended reformation with thoſe which have followed it, and ſee what a deereaſe of Truth, Piety, Devotion, Humility, Love and Obedience has hapned, ſince you ſeparated from your unerring Mothers arms, and betook your ſelves to the guidance of your own fallible interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            <p>LES nouvelles objections, que vous m'envoyez ſur le ſujet de mon Expoſition, ſont ſi legeres, que ſi je n'aprenois par un homme de votre merite, qu'elles ſont jugées de quelque poids par les Proteſtans d'Angleterre, je croirois perdre le temps d'y rê<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondre. Car qu'importe apres tout, ſi ce Liure a eſté mis en l'eſtat ou il eſt, ſur des Cenſures de la <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> comme on le veut croire, ou par mes propres reflexions? Il ſuffiſt, quoiqu'il en ſoit, qu'a preſent ni la <hi>Sorbonne</hi> ny trouve rien a dire, ny qu'aucun Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ne le contredite; &amp; qu'au contraire le Clergé de <hi>France</hi> en corps, tant de Docteurs de toutes les Nations, des Cardinaux tres illuſtres par leur Scavoir &amp; leur Pieté, le Pape meſme l'approuve. Que doit importer a un homme qui cherche la Verité, par quel mojen je ſois parvenu a eſcrire une doctrine aprouvée; puiſque enfin on ne peut nier que la mienne ne le ſoit dans toute L'Egliſe, &amp; qu'avec cette Doctrine je ne ſois univerſellement reconnu pour Eueſques tres orthodox, dans la Communion du St. Siege, &amp; de tous les Eueſques Catholiques? Coux qui Voudront dire apres cela, qu'il n'eſt pas permis d'eſtre Catholique dans la Croiance dont je fais une profeſſion ſi haute, &amp; ſi publique; cherchent a s'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veugler eux meſmes, &amp; ne veulent pas voire la Lumiere du Mydy.</p>
            <p>Apres cela Si je perſiſte a dire, comme je fais, que mon Ouvr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age n'a jamais eſté ſoumis a la cenſure de la <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> &amp; que ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenu par une authorité plus grande que la Sienne, je n'ay jamais
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104173:105"/>ſeulment ſongé en demander l'approbation, on verrà bien que ce n'eſt pas l'intereſt de mon Livre, mais le teſmoignage de la Verite qui me fera par ler ainſi.</p>
            <p>Je perſiſte encors a dire, qu'il ni a jamais eu aucune Edition de mon ouvrage avouée de moy, que celle qui eſt preſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repandüe par tout, &amp; traduitte en tant de Langues. Que si la plu a quelqu'un d'y condre les Aprobations &amp; le Privilege du Roy avec le nom de Gramoiſy, c'eſt une foible preuve pour deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir ce que je dis. Mais quand j'aurois adiouſté des cartons à une impreſſion deſia faite avant qu'elle fuſt debitée, &amp; quand i'y aurois corrigé ce qu'il m'y auroit plu, ou que je l'euſſe, ſi on le veut, tout à fait changée, quelle conſequence y auroit il a tirer contre moy de ces changemens? Mettons encors, ſi l'on veut, qu'il y euſt eu quelqu'un aſſez vainement Curieux pour avoir ſoin de trouver cette Impreſſion avantque je l'euſſe ainſi corigée, qui jamais s'eſt aviſé de faire un proces à un autheur ſur toutes ces minuties; &amp; ne voit on pas clairement, que ceux qui debitent auec tant de ſoin des choſes ſi Vaines, cherchent des chicanes &amp; non pas la verité. Apres tout, Mon Rev. Pere, ſi on parle encore de ces menües obſervations, qui ne meritent pas ſculment qu'on y reflechiſſe, &amp; que vous jugiez qu'il fuſt utile pour convaincre les opiniâtres, d'avoir une Atteſtation de la <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> qui ſiſt voir que jamais on ny à ſeulment parlé de mon Livre pour luy en demander ſon Approbation, ou le ſouſmettre à ſon examen, vous pouvez repondre aſſurement qu'on en envoira dans la forme la plus Authentique que les Eſprits contentieux pouroient deſirer. Voila pour la premiere objection.</p>
            <p>Pour la ſeconde. J'avoüe ſans peine que l'edition de mon Livre que jay publiée, differe en quelque choſe de mon Manuſcrit, dont, comme je vousay dit par mes precedentes, on avoit repandu plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs Copies; car il faut toujours ſe ſouvenir quil avoit eſte fait d'abord pour l'inſtruction de quelques particuliers, &amp; non pas pour eſtre imprimé. Par cette meſme raiſon je ne doute pas qu'on ne trouve dans les Editions que je n'a y pas avouées, quelque choſe qui ne ſera pas mot à mot ce qui aura paru dans la vraye: Mais pour peu qu'on ait d'equité, on reconnoiſtra que cette di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſité ne regarde que la netteté ou la brieveté du ſtile, &amp; jamais le fons meſme de la croyance. C'eſt meſme ce qui paroiſt dans les exemples de cette pretendüe Premier Edition que vous dittes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104173:106"/>qu'on objecte. Quand i'aurois dit, par exemple, que l'honneur que l'on rend à la St. Vierge devroit eſtre blaſmé s'il n'eſtoit pas Religieux, c'eſt a dire, s'il ne ſe raportoit pas a Dieu qui eſt l'object de la Religion, au fond il ny à rien que de tres certain; &amp; ſi dans la ſuitte je l'ay tourné d'une autro maniere, ce n'a eſté que pour parler plus brievement, &amp; pour eviter de miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables <hi>Equivoques,</hi> qu'on fait tous les jours ſur le terme de <hi>Religieux.</hi> Je voudrois bien demander aux Proteſtants d'Angleterre, ſi les Feſtes qu'on y celebre à l'honneur des Saincts ne font pas partie du culte Religieux qu'on rend à Dieu pour le remercier de les avoir ſanctifié &amp; glorifié. En un mot, &amp; pour ne point perdre le temps d'avantage, à diſcuter des choſes en l'air, &amp; des change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſi legers, qu'a peine m'en Souviens-je moy meſme, ceux qui voudront ſouſtenir qu'ils ſont plus conſiderables, que je ne dis n'ont qu'a remettre leur Edition pretendüe entre les mains de quelques perſonnes digne de fois ou je puiſſe la faire voir par quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu'un de mes Amis, je me fais fort alors ou de la convaincre d'une fauſſeté manifeſte, ou, ſi elle à eſte faite veritablement ſur mon Manuſcrit, de montrer plus clair que le jour, que ces differences qu'on releue tant, ne meritoient pas ſeulment qu'on y penſaſt.</p>
            <p>Vous voyez, Mon Rever. Pere, que j'entre autant que puis dans le deſſein de voſtre Charité envers les Infirmes; car pour moy, encors un coup, qu'ay-je à faire de me defendre de ces legers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, puiſque j'avouerois ſans difficulté de grandes fautes, ſi j'avois eſté aſſez peu inſtruit pour les faire, avec beaucoup d'acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons de graces envers Dieu qui m'auroit ouvert les yeux pour les reconnoiſtre.</p>
            <p>Sur la Troiſieſme objection il ni à rien qui me regarde en particulier, &amp; je veux bien vous dire avec franchiſe, que loin d'eſtre emeu de la lettre de St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> que vos Miniſtres accuſent la <hi>Sorbonne</hi> d'avoir Supprimée, je ſuis perſuadé au con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire qu'elle eſt tres avantageuſe a l'Egliſe; de ſorte que, bien loin de la Supprimer, je ſeray toujours d'avis qu'on la publie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me tous les autres ouvrages des Peres, ou il ni a contre la doctrine de L'egliſe que des difficultes apparantes, &amp; jamais d'objections Solides. Mais c'eſt ioy la matiere d'un autre entretien; &amp; je dois parler maintenant des objections qu'on vous fait contre mon Expoſition.</p>
            <p>On veut dans la quatrieme qu'un Catholique ait eſcrit contre
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104173:106"/>ce Livre, à cauſe qu'on à oüy dire, dit on, a Mr. <hi>Conrart</hi> qu'il avoit veu cet eſcrit. Avec la permiſſion de ceux qui objectent des choſes ſi vaines, que pretend t-on conclure de la? Et quand ſur la foi de Mr. <hi>Conrart</hi> Huguenot enteſté de ſa Religion, s'il en fuſt jamais, on voudroit croire qu'un Catholique euſt eſcrit contre moy; n'y a-t-il pas de bons &amp; de mauvais Catholiques, de Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louxs, des indeſcrets, &amp; des ignorans? Et que peut on penſer de ce Catholique qui n'a pour tout confident d'un Ouvrage qu'il entreprend contre une Eveſque de ſa Communion, que des Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots? En Verité il y à bien de la ſoibleſſe à relever, de pareilles choſes, &amp; ceux qui s'en laiſſent esbloüir, ont bien envie d'eſtre trompés.</p>
            <p>Cinquiéme objection: Je perſiſte encors' a dire que je n'ay point leu le Livre du Pere <hi>Creſſet</hi> qu on m'oppoſe; jay bien ſceu, à la verité, que Mr. <hi>Jurieux</hi> me l'oppoſoit; mais les Proteſtans eux meſme demeurans d'acord que cet Autheur meſle enſemble le vray, le faux, &amp; le douteux, je ne me croy nullement obligé à m' eſclaircir de la plus part des objections quil me fait, non plus qu'a y reſpondre. J'ajouſtera ſeulment icy, que le Pere <hi>Creſſet</hi> luy meſme, touché de ce qu'on diſoit que ſa Doctrine ne s'ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordoit pas avec la mienne, m'en à fait ſes plaintes a moy meſme, &amp; à eſcrit dans une Preface d'une ſeconde Edition de ſon Livre, qu'il ne differoit en rien d'avec moy, ſi ce n'eſt peut eſtre dans les expreſſions; ce que je laiſſe à examiner à quicon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que en voudra prendre la peine. Aux ſurplus il n'y a perſonne qui ne sçache que lors qu'il s'agiſt d'entendre les Dogmes, il faut conſiderer ce qu'on en eſcrit Theologiquement &amp; preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dans un Ouvrage Dogmatique, pluſtoſt que quelques exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations qui ſeront, peut eſtre, eſchapees dans des Livres de pieté. On parle encore dans cette cinquieme objection de ce que jay dit dans ma Lettre Paſtorale touchant ce qui s'eſt paſſé dans le Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe de <hi>Meaux,</hi> &amp; dans pluſieurs autres, dont les Eveſques mes confreres &amp; mes amis m'avoient fait le recit; &amp; moy je perſiſt à dire, ſous les yeux de Dieu, qui jugera les Vivans &amp; les morts, que je n'ay rien dit que de veritable; &amp; que l'autheur de la Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique des Lettres avoit recen un mauvais memoire, quand il a dit que je retrancherois cet Article dans les Editions ſuivantes, puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que je n'y ay pas ſeulment ſongé.</p>
            <p>Quand a ce qu'on object en ſixiéme lieu du Cardinal <hi>Capiſucchi</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:104173:107"/>vous ſçavez auſſi bien que moy, Mon R. Pere, que c'eſt une froide objection qui roule ſur l'equivoque du Mot de <hi>Latrie.</hi> Vous connoiſſez la diſtinction des Scolaſtiques entre la <hi>Latrie Abſolüe</hi> &amp; la <hi>Latrie relative.</hi> Et tout icy ſe reduit enſin ſi Viſiblement a une diſpute de mot, que je ne puis comprendre comment des gens ſenſés s'y amuſent. Pour moy qui ne m'eſtois pas propoſé de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendre les expreſſions de l'echole, quoique tres aiſées a bien expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, mais le language de L'egliſe dans les deciſions de foy je n'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois pas beſoin d'entrer dans cette ſubtilité; &amp; le Cardinal <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſucchi</hi> qui en faiſoit un traité expres, n'a rien dit en tout cela qui me ſoit contraire.</p>
            <p>La Septieme objection eſt une lettre qui me fut eſcrite il y à quelques années par un nommé <hi>Imbert</hi> qui crut s'attirer quelque protection de ma part, en me diſant quil ſoufroit perſecution pour la Doctrine de mon Livre de l'Expoſition. Je n'en crus rien; parce que je connoſſois trop Monſieur L'Archeveſque de <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſon Prelat dont il ſe plaignoit, mais comme i'ay toujours veſcu avec ce ſage Archeveſque dans une tres ſincere amitié &amp; correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, je luy eſcrivis ſur ce ſujet. J'appris que ce Monſieur <hi>Imbert</hi> eſtoit une teſte malfaite, qui avoit fait juſque dans L'egliſe des extravagances ſignalées, dont il n'avoit eü gard de ſe venter au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres de moy; il s'eſtoit meſlé dans ſa conduitte beaucoup d'autres choſes fort irregulieres qui m'empeſcherent d'entrer plus avant dans cette affaire, &amp; d'interceder pour un homme, ou d'abord je n'avois cru que de la foibleſſe &amp; de l'ignorance. Cependant les Proteſtans imprime la lettre de cet homme, &amp; la ſimple allegation d'un tel teſmoin deuiendra, s'il plaiſt à Dieu, une preuve contre moy. Je vous le dit devant Dieu, Mon Re. Pere, j'ay le coeur ſerré quand je vois des objections de cette nature relevées ſerieuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dans des Livres, &amp; je demande a Dieu, dans le gemiſſement de mon coeur, O Seigneur, ſouffrirez vous encors long temps que des ames Chreſtiennes ſe laiſſent prendre dans de ſi fragiles lacets?</p>
            <p>Les extraits du Cardinal <hi>Bona</hi> qu'on raporte dans la derniere objection, regarde la difficulté commune, tant rebattüe par les Proteſtans, ſur la maniere de prier les Saincts. Cette difficulté conſiſt en ce que comme ceux qui prient avec efficace &amp; qui obtien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent l'effet de leurs Voeux ſont quelque fois regardes comme faiſans les choſes à leur maniere, il arrive auſſi quelqueſois, qu'au lieu
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104173:107"/>de dire aux Saincts, <hi>priez,</hi> on leur dit, <hi>faites,</hi> en ſouſentendant toujours que ceſt par leurs <hi>prieres</hi> Seulment qu'ils <hi>font.</hi> Par de telles objections on fera voir au St. Eſprit qu'il a tort quand il dit ſi ſouvent dans l'Eſcriture, que les Saincts ont fait ce que Dieu à fait par eux, &amp; a leurs prieres. Si ces facons de parler ſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent dans l'Eſcriture, pourquoy ne voudroit-t-on pas qu'elles ſe trouvent auſſi dans les prieres de l'Egliſe.

Et ſi la choſe n'eſtoit pas encors expliquées par les pricres de l'Egliſe, pouvoit il reſter aucun doute apres les explications que jay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portées du Catechiſme du Concile, &amp; apres les deciſions du Concile meſme? Car, je vous prie, penſons un peu entre nous ce qu'il enſeigne dans la Seſſion 25. Ne poſe-t-il pas pour fonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment de l'invocation qu'on leur addreſſe, qu'ils offrent des prieres pour nous? Par conſequent le deſſein eſt d'enſeigner que <hi>leur puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance eſt dans leurs prieres.</hi> Et on nous demande apres cela des nouvelles explications, comme ſi le Concil de <hi>Trent</hi> ne s'eſtoit pas aſſez expliqué ſur une matiere d'aillieurs tres claire. En Verité, Mon Reverend Pere, cela aſlige un Coeur Chreſtien, de voir que le ſens de l'Egliſe eſtant ſi bien eſclaircy dans ſes deciſions, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinüe encors a nous chicaner ſur des Mots.</p>
            <p>Je ne vous parleray point de l'affair de Monſieur de <hi>Witte</hi> Paſteur de St. <hi>Marie</hi> de <hi>Maline;</hi> je ne vois rien la dedans qui me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde en particulier, non plus que dans les lettres du Clergé ſur le ſujet de quelques Brefs du Pape.

            <p>THE new Objections you ſend me upon the Subject of my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition are ſo ſlight and inconſiderable, that if I were not aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a Perſon of your Merit, they are thought of ſome weight by the Engliſh Proteſtants, I ſhould think my time loſt to reply to them; For, after all this bustle, what matters it, whether this Book were reduced to what it is, by the Cenſure of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> (as they would have it thought) or by my own proper reflections? Which ſoever it was, it is ſufficient, that the <hi>Sorbon</hi> has nothing now to ſay againſt it, neither do's any Catholic contradict it; on the contrary the whole Clergy of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:104173:108"/>and a multitude of Doctors of all other Nations, as alſo of Cardinals famous for their Learning and Piety, nay even the Pope himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it. What needs any one, who ſearcheth after Truth, concern himſelf to inquire by what means I came to Write approved Doctrin, ſeeing 'tis certain they cannot deny mine to be ſo throughout the whole Church, nor that I am in the Profeſſion of this Doctrin, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally acknowledged to be an Orthodox Biſhop, in Communion with the Holy See and all other Catholic Biſhops? They who, notwithſtanding all this, ſay he cannot be a Catholic who retains the Faith which I ſo loudly and ſo publickly profeſs, take pains to blind themſelves and will not ſee the light at Noon-day.</p>
            <p>If after this I perſiſt to ſay, as I do, that my Book was never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Cenſure of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and that being ſupported by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority than That, I never Dream't of asking it's Approbation; It will plainly appear, that it is not the Advantage of my Book, but the Teſtimony of Truth that makes me ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>I continue ſtill to ſay, there was never any Edition of my Book own'd and avowed by me, but that which is now every where ſpread abroad, and Tranſlated into ſo many Languages: But if ſome Body has been pleaſed, to tack the Kings Approbation and Privilege, with the Name of <hi>Cramoiſy,</hi> to ſome other Edition, it is but a weak Argument to give the lie to what I ſay. But what if I had made ſome Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a Printed Impreſſion, before it was made public; what if I had corrected in it what I thought fit, or, if they pleaſe, altogether changed it? What conſequence can they draw from thence againſt me upon account of thoſe Alterations? Let us put the caſe alſo, if they pleaſe, that ſome Body ſhould have been, ſo vainly curious, as to take the trouble to find out this Impreſſion before I had thus corrected it; who has ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to quarrel with an Author for ſuch trifles? Is it not plain that ſuch Men, as take ſo much pains to publiſh ſuch fooliſh things, ſeek not the Truth, but to juggle and perplex the World with Tricks? After all, Reverend Father, if they ſtill continue to talk of theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which do not deſerve ſo much as to be reflected on, and that you Judge it profitable for the Conviction of Opiniators to have an Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> to make it appear that their Approbation was not ſo much as demanded to my Book, or that it was not at all ſubmitted to their cenſure, you may anſwer with aſſurance, that they will ſend it in the moſt Authentic Form, that contentious Spirits can deſire, This to the firſt Objection.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:104173:109"/>
            <p>As to the Second I do readily acknowledge; that the Edition of my Book which I publiſhed, differs in ſome things from my Manuſcript, of which as I told you in my laſt, many Copies had been ſcattered about; for you muſt always remember, that it was at firſt made for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome particulars and not to be Printed: And for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I do not doubt but they may find in the Edition which I did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, ſome things not agreeing word for word with the True one; but a little Juſtice muſt needs make them acknowledge the difference there to regard only the Beauty or Conciſeneſs of the Style, and not at all the Subſtance of the Faith. This is viſible even in the inſtances, which you ſay they produce from that pretended firſt Edition. Had I ſaid, for Example, that the honor which is given to the Bleſſed Virgin ought to be blamed, if it were not <hi>Religious,</hi> that is to ſay, if it did not refer to God, who is the Object of Religion; there is nothing but truth in that expreſſion, if we examin it to the bottom: And if afterwards I have given it another Turn, it is only that I might ſpeak with more Brevity, and avoid the Pitiful Equivocations which are every day made upon the Word <hi>Religious:</hi> I would fain ask the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> if the Feaſts they there Celebrate in honor of the Saints, do not make a part of the Religious Worſhip they pay to God, in Teſtimony of their thanks for his having Sanctified them, and Crown'd them with Glory? In a word, that I may not loſe time in diſcuſſing ſuch trivial things, and ſlight changes, that I can ſcarce remember 'em my ſelf, let ſuch as are minded to maintain them to be more conſiderable, than I ſay they are, only put their pretended Edition into the hands of ſome perſon of Credit, where I may have it ſeen by ſome of my Friends; and I do then engage my ſelf either to ſhew the manifeſt Falſity of it; or, if it has been truly Printed after my Manuſcript, to make appear as clear as the day, that the differences, they ſo much magnifie, deſerve not even to be thought upon. You ſee, Reverend Father, that I perſue as far as I can the deſign of your Charity towards the weak; for as to my ſelf, once more, what have I to do to defend ſuch ſlight corrections; ſeeing I ſhould be very ready to acknowledge great faults, had I been ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed to commit them, with much hearty Thankfullneſs towards God who had open'd my Eyes to ſee them.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the Third Objection, that particularly concerns me, and I muſt tell you freely, I am ſo far from being moved by the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> which your Miniſters tax the <hi>Sorbon</hi> to have ſuppreſt, that on the contrary I am perſwaded it is very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104173:109"/>to the Church; Inſomuch that I am ſo far from ſuppreſſing of it, That I ſhall always adviſe it ſhould be Publiſhed, as all the other works of the Fathers, in which there is only ſome difficulties in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but never any ſolid Objections againſt the Doctrin of the Church. But this is the Subject of another entertainment; and I muſt ſpeak at preſent of the Objections they bring you againſt my Expoſition.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth Objection they will have it that a Catholic has Writ againſt my Book, becauſe they have (as they ſay) heard M. <hi>Conrart</hi> ſay, that he had ſeen the Writings. With their Permiſſion who make ſuch vain Objections; what do they pretend to conclude from thence? And ſuppoſe, upon the Credit of Monſieur <hi>Conrart</hi> a Huguenot, hot headed (if any one ever was) with his Religion, they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be perſuaded, that a Catholic did Write againſt me; Are there not Good and had Catholics; Jealous, Indiſcreet, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ones? And what can any one think of ſuch a Catholic, who has none but Huguenots, for his Confidents in a work he undertakes againſt a Biſhop of his own Communion? Certainly it ſhews a great weakneſs to magnifie ſuch poor Objections; And they who ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed on by them, muſt needs have a mighty incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be deceived.</p>
            <p>Fifth Objection, I ſtill continue to ſay, that I have never Read Father <hi>Creſſets</hi> Book which they bring againſt me; I know well, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Monſieur <hi>Jurieux</hi> Objected it to me; but ſeeing Proteſtants themſelves acknowledge this Author to mingle True, Falſe and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things together, I do not think I am at all obliged to inform my ſelf of the greateſt part of the Objections that he brings againſt me any more, than, I do to anſwer him; I will only add here, that Father <hi>Creſſet</hi> himſelf, troubled and offended that any one ſhould report his Doctrin to be different from mine, has made his complaints to me; and in a Preface to the Second Edition of his Book, has declared, that he varied in nothing from me, unleſs perhaps in the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which whether it be ſo or no, I leave to them to Examin, who will pleaſe to give themſelves the trouble. Moreover every body knows, that when we would underſtand what is Doctrinal, we muſt conſider what is Written Theologically and preciſely in a Dogmatical work, and not ſome exaggerations, which may have eſcaped in ſome Books of Devotion.</p>
            <p>In this Fifth Objection they alſo take notice, of what I ſaid in my Paſtoral Letter, touching that which paſſed in the Dioceſs of <hi>Meaux,</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104173:110"/>and ſeveral others, as I was informed by the Biſhops my Brethren, and other my Friends. And I do again aſſert in the Preſence of God, who is to Judge the Living and the Dead, that I ſpoke nothing but the Truth, and that the Author <hi>de la Republique des Lettres,</hi> received very bad intelligence, when he ſaid that I intended to ſtrike that Clauſe out of the following Editions; whereas for my part I never ſo much as Dreamt of doing it.</p>
            <p>As for what they Object in the Sixth place about Cardinal <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucchi,</hi> you ſee as well as I, Reverend Father, that it is a weak Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which runs upon the Equivocation of the word <hi>Latria,</hi> you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the School Diſtinctions between Abſolute and Relative Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And in ſhort all this falls ſo viſibly into a Diſpute about words, that I cannot imagin how Men of Senſe, can amuſe themſelves about it. As for me, who never engaged my ſelf to defend the expreſſions of the School, tho' never ſo eaſie to be explicated, but only the Language of the Church in her deciſions of Faith, I was not obliged to enter into thoſe ſubtilties; And Cardinal <hi>Capiſucchi,</hi> who has Writ an expreſs Treatiſe of them, has ſaid nothing in the whole that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts me.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Objection is a Letter Written to me, ſome Years ſince, by one <hi>Imbert,</hi> who hoped he ſhould obtain ſome Protection from me by telling me he ſuffered Perſecution upon account of the ſame Doctrin, taught by me, in the Book of my Expoſition; I did not believe him, becauſe I was too well acquainted with my Lord the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> his Dioceſan, of whom he made his complaint; But as I had always lived in a ſtrict correſpondence and Friendſhip with that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, I wrote to him upon this Subject, and underſtood that this Mr. <hi>Imbert</hi> was a hot-headed Man, who had done, even in the Church, very remarkable extravagancies, which he was more cautious than to boaſt of to me. His conduct had been tainted with many other irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which indeed hindered me from intereſting my ſelf for him any further in the buſineſs, or to intercede for one, in whom I had found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weakneſs mixed with Ignorance. Nevertheleſs Proteſtants Print this Mans Letter, and the ſingle Allegation of ſuch a Witneſs muſt become, God willing, a proof againſt me. I ſpeak it in the Preſence of God (Reverend Father) my Heart is grieved to ſee Objections, of ſo poor a Nature ſeriouſly preſſed in Books; And I beg of Almighty God in the anguiſh of my Soul, O Lord wilt thou ſtill continue to ſuffer Chriſtian Souls to let themſelves be caught in ſuch weak and miſerable Snares!</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:104173:110"/>
            <p>The Extracts from Cardinal <hi>Bona,</hi> which they bring in the laſt Objection, regard the Common difficulty ſo often propoſed by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants about Prayer to Saints. The Difficulty conſiſts in this, that as they who Pray with efficacy, and obtain the effect of their deſires, are ſometimes conſidered as the doers of the things after their manner; It happens alſo ſometimes, that inſtead of ſaying to the Saints <hi>Pray for us,</hi> they ſay, <hi>do this;</hi> always underſtanding that it is by their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they do it. By ſuch Objections the Holy Ghoſt might be blamed, for ſaying ſo often in the Scriptures, that the Saints have done that which God has done by them, and at their Prayers. If ſuch manners of ſpeaking be familiar in Scripture, why will they not alſo have them uſed in the Prayers of the Church? But is it poſſible to explain ones ſelf more clearly than the Church does upon this Subject; ſeeing for one time you find (and that in the Hymns and other Poetical works) that we Pray the Saints <hi>to do,</hi> or to <hi>Grant,</hi> ſome thing, you will meet with it a Thouſand times Explicated, that they do it only by their <hi>Interceſſion</hi> and <hi>Prayers?</hi> And had not the thing been already expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Prayers of the Church, could there yet remain any doubt after the Expoſitions I have brought out of the Councils Catechiſm, and after the deciſion of the Council it ſelf? For I beſeech you let us weigh a little with our ſelves what it Teaches in the Twenty fifth Seſſion, does it not put this as a Foundation of the Invocation which we make to them, that they offer up Prayers for us? And conſequently it's deſign is to ſhew us their Power is in their Prayers, and yet, new Explications are ſtill demanded, as if the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had not ſufficiently declared her Doctrin in a matter otherwiſe very clear. Truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father, it extreamly troubles a Chriſtians Heart, to ſee, tho' the Senſe of the Church be made ſo very Evident, in her deciſions, People ſhould continue ſtill thus to Juggle and Cavil with us about words.</p>
            <p>I will ſay nothing about Mr. De <hi>Witte</hi> Rector of St. <hi>Maries</hi> of <hi>Meckline.</hi> I find nothing in that Objection which concerns me in particular, nor in the Letters of the Clergy, upon the Subject of ſome briefs from the Pope. Nobody ever pretends to offend his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or in the leaſt title to diminiſh the Authority of his See, by ſaying, that things may proceed thence which may not always be according to Rule. On the contrary Proteſtants my obſerve from ſuch Examples, that a Church may with reſpect maintain, what ſhe thinks to be her Right, without either breaking <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity or hurting Subordination.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:104173:111"/>
            <p>Pardon me, Reverend Father, for making this return ſo late, my Employments of another Nature which would not give me leiſure ſooner, muſt (with your leave) be my excuſe. I conclude praiſing your Zeal, which will not ſuffer you to mitigate the urgent deſires you have for the Salvation of your Brethren. I am with particular Eſteem,</p>
